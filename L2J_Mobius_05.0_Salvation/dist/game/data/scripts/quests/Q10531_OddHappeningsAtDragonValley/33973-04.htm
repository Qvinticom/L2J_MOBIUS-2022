While it's not too meaningful in itself to lay down boundaries in <font color="LEVEL">Dragon Valley</font>, its a necessary step of the investigation. So for now, I want to send you to the less dangerous region to reduce the numbers of dragons and Undead there. On the west side of Dragon Valley, you'll find <font color="LEVEL">Mesmer Dragon, Gargoyle Dragon, Black Dragon, Esmerald Dragon, Sand Dragon, Dragonblood Captain, Dragonblood Minion, Cave Servant Archer, Cave Servant Warrior, Metal Cave Servant, Iron Cave Servant</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Headless Knight</font>. You need to slay <font color="LEVEL">200</font> of them. While you eliminate the threats that get in the way of the investigation, we will strive to identify the cause and come you with a plan.<br>
