Ah, so you wish to bestow a special ability onto your weapon! Good idea. Enchantment? No worries. Bestowing a special ability won't make the enchantment disappear.<br>
Oh, and I have some important news. The skills of all the blacksmiths have improved greatly. You don't need to go through the Blacksmith of Mammon or the Black Marketeer of Mammon <font color="LEVEL">to bestow a Soul Crystal effect onto weapons</font> anymore.<br>
It looks like they stopped bestowing special abilities. Wait, did you know this already?<br>
Choose the capabilities you wish to add to your weapons!<br>
