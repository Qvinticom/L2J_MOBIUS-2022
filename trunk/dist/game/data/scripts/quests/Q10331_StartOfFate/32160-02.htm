This island changed rapidly after the Island in the Sky fell. Plants, vegetation, and monsters from the time of Giants have been found everywhere. Of course, plants and vegetation can do little harm, but the monsters are something else... especially in the Ruins of Ye Sagira.<br>
I know this is a dangerous task, but I was hoping you could look into the incident in the Ruins of Ye Sagira, and become a member of the Rangers.<br>
What do you think? Why don't you test yourself here? If you complete the mission, I will let you undergo a <font color="LEVEL">Class Transfer</font> so that you can awaken the potential ability inside you.<br>
