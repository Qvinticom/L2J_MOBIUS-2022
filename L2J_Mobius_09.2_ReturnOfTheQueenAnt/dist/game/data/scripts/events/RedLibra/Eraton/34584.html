Have you ever through oh wanting to change your <font color="LEVEL">destiny</font>?  Normally... that's impossible. But the <font color="LEVEL">%required_item%</font> makes the impossible, possible.<br>
If you bring me a %required_item%, I will change your <font color="LEVEL">main class</font> for you. Also, don't forget bring me the <font color="LEVEL">Main Class Cloak</font> as well.<br>
Please remember that you may obtain new things by changing your destiny, but you may also lose some things. If this worries you, I can tell you about these things.<br>
What can I help you with?<br>
