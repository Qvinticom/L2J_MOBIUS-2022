Hello! My name is Antri.<br>
The king has commanded the Order of Knights, to which I belong, to defeat the Queen Ant.<br>
Something weird has been going on near the Ant Nest. Unfortunately, our order is not strong enough to cope with this problem. That's why I am assigned to find brave heroes who will not be afraid to go to the Ant Nest and kill the Queen Ant.<br>
As you cannot defeat this monster alone, you should prepare well and gather your allies.<br>
