This place, the Talking Island, changed rapidly after the Island in the Sky came crashing down. Monsters from it started roaming the lands, leaving us all in grave danger, especially outside our little village here. The Ruins of Ye Sagira seems to be the most dangerous spot at the moment, and we've only been able to send a small contingent of scouts out there.<br>
I would like you to join them, friend, and help them as best you can. Complete your task, and I'll be more than happy to <font color="LEVEL">transfer your class</font> for you.<br>
What do you say?<br>
