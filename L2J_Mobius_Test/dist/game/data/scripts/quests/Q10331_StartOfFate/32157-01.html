You, my friend, have some extraordinary abilities, which should be allowed to flourish. I've been giving it some though, and I think we need to get you off this island and out into the wider world, so you can spread your wings and let that potential blossom. I propose a test. If you pass, you'll have more opportunities to travel and grow.<br>
