<html><body>High Prefect Took:<br>
Sebion is injured? That's surprising... he has such strong magic, I wouldn't have thought.... That's strange. I'll have to send in additional support workers.<br>
We need to hire a Bloodhound for his return. King? Is that his name? Yes, we'll need King to protect Sebion's return journey. Thanks for your detailed report. May blessing of darkness enhance your future.
