/**
 * Blink effect implementation.<br>
 * This class handles warp effects, disappear and quickly turn up in a near location.<br>
 * If geodata enabled and an object is between initial and final point, flight is stopped just before colliding with object.<br>
 * Flight course and radius are set as skill properties (flyCourse and flyRadius):
 * <ul>
 * <li>Fly Radius means the distance between starting point and final point, it must be an integer.</li>
 * <li>Fly Course means the movement direction: imagine a compass above player's head, making north player's heading. So if fly course is 180, player will go backwards (good for blink, e.g.).</li>
 * </ul>
 * By the way, if flyCourse = 360 or 0, player will be moved in in front of him.<br>
 * If target is effector, put in XML self="1", this will make _actor = getEffector(). This, combined with target type, allows more complex actions like flying target's backwards or player's backwards.
