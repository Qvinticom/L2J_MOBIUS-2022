		 * This text was wrote by XaKa
		 * QuestList packet structure:
		 * {
		 * 		1 byte - 0x80
		 * 		2 byte - Number of Quests
		 * 		for Quest in AvailibleQuests
		 * 		{
		 * 			4 byte - Quest ID
		 * 			4 byte - Quest Status
		 * 		}
		 * }
		 * 
		 * NOTE: The following special constructs are true for the 4-byte Quest Status:
		 * If the most significant bit is 0, this means that no progress-step got skipped.
		 * In this case, merely passing the rank of the latest step gets the client to mark
		 * it as current and mark all previous steps as complete.
		 * If the most significant bit is 1, it means that some steps may have been skipped.
		 * In that case, each bit represents a quest step (max 30) with 0 indicating that it was
		 * skipped and 1 indicating that it either got completed or is currently active (the client
		 * will automatically assume the largest step as active and all smaller ones as completed).
		 * For example, the following bit sequences will yield the same results:
		 * 1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0011 1111 1111: Indicates some steps may be skipped but each of
		 * the first 10 steps did not get skipped and current step is the 10th.
		 * 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1010: Indicates that no steps were skipped and current is the 10th.
		 * It is speculated that the latter will be processed faster by the client, so it is preferred when no
		 * steps have been skipped.
		 * However, the sequence "1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0010 1101 1111" indicates that the current step is
		 * the 10th but the 6th and 9th are not to be shown at all (not completed, either).
