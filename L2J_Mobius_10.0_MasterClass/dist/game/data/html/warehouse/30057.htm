<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Amidol:<br>
Are you going to hit the road? I hope you have no intention to carry all of your belongings with you. I know it's all none of my business, but if I were you I'd take just only necessaries. The Iron Gate Guild can keep your belongings until your return.<br>
Besides, if you want you can get it back in any town or village.<br>
