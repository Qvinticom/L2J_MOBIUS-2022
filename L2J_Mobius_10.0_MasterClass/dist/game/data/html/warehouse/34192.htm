<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Fouette:<br>
Hello. You know, when I was assigned to work at the local warehouse, I got a bit scared. But it turned out to be quite a cushy job.<br>
Nowadays there are not many people here, but I'm sure sooner or later this place will get really popular with the adventurers. Hahahaha!<br>
By the way, you should check out our tavern if you have the time. Tell the owner Settlen that Fouette sent you. He might have something for you to do. Settlen is a rather peculiar person. Have a chat with him, you'll see. Haha!
