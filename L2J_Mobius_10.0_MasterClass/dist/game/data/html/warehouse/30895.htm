<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Kluck:<br>
Welcome, adventurer! It's great that you've decided to visit the Iron Gate Guild of Heine. Would you like to store some items with us? Or maybe withdraw something of yours? Maybe you'd like to learn some skills? I've been feeling like I'm always busy lately... Not, it's not a feeling, I'm actually busy all the time! I don't sleep enough! Our guild is currently swamped with work, you see... Well, I should thank gods that I don't answer for everything, I guess.<br>
