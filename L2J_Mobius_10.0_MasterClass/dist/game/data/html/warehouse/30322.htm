<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Balcon:<br>
Welcome! I've been making quite a fortune lately. The business is doing great, we've got a lot of clients. If all goes well I might even get to run the local branch of the Iron Gate Guild. Don't tell anyone, okay?<br>
By the way, you can get your belongings back anywhere you want, but only if you left them in storage yourself.<br>
