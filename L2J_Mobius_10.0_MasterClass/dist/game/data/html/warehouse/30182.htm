<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Cliff:<br>
Welcome! A lot of heavy stuff? Put it here...<br>
This is a warehouse of the Dwarven Bank Union. We will keep your belongings safe, so you don't need to worry about them. Dwarven warehouses are strong, well-crafted, and safe, nobody could get in there, even in times of wars... Giants against Gods, Elmore, and so on. No robberies, believe me.<br>
