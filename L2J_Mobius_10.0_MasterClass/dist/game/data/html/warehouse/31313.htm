<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Lunin:<br>
I've spent half a century working at the warehouse and the thing I learnt is that money likes to change hands. Up until last year all trade in Rune was controlled by the Van Halter clan. These days however the Benandati Traders' Guild has cornered the market.<br>
That's what you ought to know if you're setting up shop in such a dangerous place... Well, that's how it is.<br>
