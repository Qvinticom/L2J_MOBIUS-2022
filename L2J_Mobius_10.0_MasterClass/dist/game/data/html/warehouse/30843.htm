<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Romp:<br>
You shouldn't let your guard down even outside Aden. The border is a stone's throw away and nobody knows what tomorrow may bring. So there's that. That's why our warehouse is so useful, eh? Let us store your items. You don't need that much stuff on you anyway. Anything you entrust us with will be safe and sound. That is for certain. Nothing will happen to them even if you die.<br>
