<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Walderal:<br>
Running a warehouse you can't help but find out some juicy things about certain people. Say, why would a high-ranking official leave a nice rag doll in this warehouse a few days ago? The doll is finely crafted, sure, but still you can buy one for cheaper than he paid for the storage. You know what I'm saying? Heh-heh.<br>
