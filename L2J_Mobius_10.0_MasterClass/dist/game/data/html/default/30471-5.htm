If equipment is augmented, it has better characteristics. If you need to augment something or remove augmentation, let me know.<br>
Do you know that it's impossible to find Life Stones these days? But don't worry, more powerful <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stones</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Augmenting Stones</font> have been discovered. They were created from Life Stones affected by dimensional energy.<br>
If you have Life Stones, you can still use them for augmentation. Also you can bring them to me to <font color="LEVEL">exchange them for Spirit Stones</font>.<br>
