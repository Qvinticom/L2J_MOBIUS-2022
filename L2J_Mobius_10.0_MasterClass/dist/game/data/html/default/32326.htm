We are worried about the situation. Monsters have become stronger, and it's all because of the attribute energy. I'm afraid you cannot deal with them on you rown. But don't panic, fortunately right now we are testing a potion that can help you control attributes. Well, it's not perfect but still it's better than nothing, right?<br>
But I cannot give the potion for free. You know, it's not easy to obtain rare materials for making it. My students have risked their lives to get them, so I think they deserve a reward.<br>
