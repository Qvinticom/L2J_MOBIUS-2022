Augmentation imbues weapon and accessories with special power. To augment items you need Life Stones, but as fate would have it, there is no way to obtain them anymore.<br>
Thogh there is no need to worry. More powerful stones have been discovered, they're called <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stones</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Augmenting Stones</font>. The stones were created from Life Stones affected by dimensional energy, so don't worry.<br>
If you have Life Stones, you can use them for augmentation. Or I can <font color="LEVEL">exchange them for Spirit Stones</font>, if you want.<br>
So, what do you need? Augment an item or remove augmentation?<br>
