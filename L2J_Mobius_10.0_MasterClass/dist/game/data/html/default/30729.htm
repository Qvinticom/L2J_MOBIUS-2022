Heh-heh... I know you... You look so, hic, brave... But I'm no fool either, hic, I know a thing or two about life... You should mind your own business, hic. There used to be this escort guy, his, and he was also very curious, if you know what I'm saying. In the end he lost everything, hic, even his family. That's when he realised, hic, that he'd gone way to far... But there was no going back. No going back, you hear! Sob<br>
