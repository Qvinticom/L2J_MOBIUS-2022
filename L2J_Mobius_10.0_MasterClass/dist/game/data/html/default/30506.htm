For the Fire!<br>
Greetings! I am Fire Master! I was sent to the Town of Gludio, and I am responsible for the Noble Spirit of Orcs. You will meet numerous Orcs all around the world, but they have left their pride, honor, privileges, and know they live like worms. Turek, Enku and Vuku are living examples of this shame! They should be cursed! How dare they to leave the magnificent Fire Spirit and to come down like this! You should never forget what happened to them and you should make all efforts to avoid their fate.<br>
