More and more customers are interested in augmenting their weapons. Don't worry about grade of your equipment, when it comes to augmentation, I'm a professional.<br>
To augment items you need Life Stones which are nowhere to be found nowadays. But it's not a problem, because new powerful stones have been discovered. They are called <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stones</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Augmenting Stones</font>. They were created from Life Stones affected by dimensional energy.<br>
If you have Life Stones, they can still be used for augmentation. But I can also <font color="LEVEL">exchange them for Spirit Stones</font>, if you want.<br>
