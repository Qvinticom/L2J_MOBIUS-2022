Many great masters of augmentation have been trained by the Black Anvil Guild. I'm one of them, hoho. I'm sure that the items I craft are of highest quality.<br>
Do you know that Life Stones can't be obtained any more? But they say, more powerful stones - <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stones</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Augmenting Stones</font> - have been discovered. The stones were created from Life Stones affected by dimensional energy.<br>
If you have Life Stones, you can use them for augmentation. Well, if you want, you can exchange Life Stones for <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stones</font>.<br>
