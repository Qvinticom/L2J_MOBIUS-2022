There is nothing eternal in this world except for the flame of Pa'agrio!<br>
Greetings! I help those who study here in Gludio. There are many things that strike our sight, hearing and mind, but while learning you should know how to ignore it! Once you have a goal, you can't get distracted by little things. Look forward! And if something stands in your way, get rid of it without any hesitation, in honor of a holy flame!<br>
