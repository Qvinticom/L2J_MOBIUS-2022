<html><body>Captain Kurtiz:<br>
Aden was built in the manner of the Giant era. The castle roof is held by massive pillars, and the castle itself is surrounded by an impenetrable wall. From the standpoint of military it is almost invunerable. Even if all forces of Elmore are going to intrude here, the town can be defended by only 5 thousand warriors...<br>
But usually the more fortified a castle is outside, the more defenceless it is inside... The duty of our guards is to neutralize spies preliminarily... And everybody else who can pose a threat to the city.<br>
