Graceful like a swan gliding across a lake, free as a butterfly over a spring meadow. Sound like poetry, doesn't it? And still any warrior should take these words to heart. You can't expect raw strength to carry you through life. The more experience you have, the better you can see your opponents weak spots while staying collected and alert.<br>
