Hello there. My name is Bellra. I help adventurers to travel to instance zones. I can teleport you to Tauti, Frintezza or Octavis. Only a command channel leader can submit the request to enter to them. A command channel has to include from 21 to 35 members of Lv. 107 and highter. Instance zone counter is reset at 6:30 a.m every Saturday. Please, remember it.<br>
