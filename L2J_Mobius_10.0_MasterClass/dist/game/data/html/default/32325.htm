We are worried about the situation. Monsters have become stronger, and it's all because of the attribute energy. I'm afraid you cannot deal with them on your own. But don't panic, fortunately right now we are testing a potion that can help you control attribute. Well, it's not perfect but still it's better than nothing, right ?<br>
But I cannot give you the potion for free. You know, it's not so easy to obtain rare materials for making it. My students have risked their lives to get them, so I think they deserve a reward.<br>
