That's right, here you can augment items and remove augmentations. But please be quick.<br>
Do you have Life Stones? As I know, Life Stones can't be obtained any more. But I've heard that new, more powerfuls tones have been discovered, they're called <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stones</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Augmenting Stones</font>. The stones were created from Life Stones affected by dimensional energy.<br>
If you still have Life Stones, you can use them for augmentation. By the way, I can <font color="LEVEL">exchange them for Spirit Stones</font>.<br>
