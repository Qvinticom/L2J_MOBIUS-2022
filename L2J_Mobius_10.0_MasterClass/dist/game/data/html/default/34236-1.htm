The Kingdom's Royal Guard Talisman is a talisman that has been developed with help from the outstanding wizards of Aden.<br>
You'll have to find the ingredients yourself, but if you help us with our work, we can provide some of the more important ingredients.<br>
We also continue to improve the performance of the talismans, and if you want, their performance can be improved.<br>
