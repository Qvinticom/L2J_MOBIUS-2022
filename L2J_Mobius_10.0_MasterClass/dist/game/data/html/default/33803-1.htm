<html><body>Priestess of Light Razen:<br>
The power you attained through <font color="LEVEL">Awakening</font> is indeed great, but it is the power of the Giants. <font color="LEVEL">Skills</font> in particular are the essence of the Giants' abilities.<br>
But against Triol the devil, the greatest weapon would be the power of light bestowed by Einhasad the goddess.<br>
No need to regret your Awakening, however. Excluding skills and servitors' abilities, all of your general attacks are imbued with the <font color="LEVEL">power of the light inside you</font>. They will be critical in defeating the pagans.<br>
Also, remember that you will be kicked out if you <font color="LEVEL">hunt with 5 or more comrades</font> in this waiting room.<br>
