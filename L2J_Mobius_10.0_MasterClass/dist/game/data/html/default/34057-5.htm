Lady Leona is head of the Blackbird Clan. Their days of glory are long gone. The clan is rumoured to have grown weak over recent years... However, legends about the bravery of the Blackbirds are still being told.<br>
As a true daughter of the Blackbirds, Leona has set off Embryo in spite of the danger.<br>
I haven't heard from her for a long time already which troubles me much.<br>
