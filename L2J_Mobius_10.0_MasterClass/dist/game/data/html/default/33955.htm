<html><body>Bard Liberator:<br>
I am Bard Liberator, a true poetic voice of this world! Aren't we all tired of dusty tales of old? I want to sing new songs, that's why I write only about modern-time heroes.<br>
Ah, it's not a secret that true heroes are born in times of turmoil. And I keep record of their adventures to pass the tales on to generations yet unborn. May be through those tales they'll see how difficult our time was.
