Sure, I can augment items as well. Do you need to augment something? Good!
Do you know that Life Stones can't be obtained any more? Fortunately, more powerful stones have been discovered, they're called <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stones</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Augmenting Stones</font>. The stones were created from Life Stones affected by dimensional energy, so don't worry.<br>
If you have Life Stones, you can use them for augmentation. Or I can <font color="LEVEL">exchange them for Spirit Stones</font>, if you want.<br>
