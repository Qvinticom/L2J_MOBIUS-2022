Do you want to augment an item? I'll do it, just say the word.<br>
Do you know that Life Stones can't be obtained any more? Apparently, you don't. Fortunately, more powerful stones have been discovered, they're called <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stones</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Augmenting Stones</font>. The Stones were created from Life Stones affected by dimensional energy, so don't worry.<br>
Of course, if you have Life Stones, you can use them for augmentation as well. Also you can give them to me, and I'll <font color="LEVEL">exchange them for Spirit Stones</font>. Keep that in mind.<br>
