Hoho! Do you want to add special properties to your weapon? Good! Hm, you look worried for some reason... Oh, your weapon is enchanted, right? Don't fret about it! Your weapon's enchant value will not be affected.<br>
Oh! I have important news! Blacksmiths have acquired a new level of mastery lately! Now <font color="LEVEL">any Blacksmith can add a Soul Crystal Effect to a weapon of any grade</font> without the help of Blacksmith of Black Marketeer of Mammon.<br>
Blacksmith and Black Marketeer of Mammon have decided to stop doing that. Oh, did you know this already?<br>
Now it's time to choose what properties you want your weapon to be imbued with!<br>
