Oh... Welcome! Are you tired? You can rest here. What brings you to the Hunters Village? Well, keep your secrets then. Like I don't know why people come to the Hunters Village! They want to hunt... Am I wrong now? Am I?<br>
This village is a home for hunters. Don't just stand there, come over here and take a look at the goods. Or did you think I'm one of those shopkeeps that just lounge around all day talking about nothing?<br>
