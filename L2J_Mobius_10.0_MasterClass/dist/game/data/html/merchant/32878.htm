<html><body>Sparky:<br>
Hey, listen to me. Look around! There is so little space! All day I stand here listening to the murmur of water somewhere... And I can't even leave this place! I'm about to lose my mind!<br>
I want to run outside, but because of visitors like you I can't leave this place. But don't get me wrong, I'm happy that you're here. No visitors means no news and that would make my life even more miserable.<br>
Never forget that being free to go wherever you like is a blessing.<br>
I have recipes for items, but they are only availabe for characters that are of <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 85+ and have completed the 4th class change</font>. It's very important!
