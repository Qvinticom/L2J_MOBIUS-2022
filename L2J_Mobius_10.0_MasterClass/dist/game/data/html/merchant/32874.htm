It's too boring here. This place is not meant for people like me. There is nothing pleasent here and believe me, I looked... <br>
Tell me, do you think that nice little clothes would suit me? One day I'll finish the recipe for beautiful clothes that suit me and I'll show you.<br>
I have recipes for items, but they are only availabe for characters that are of <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 85+ and have completed the 4th class change</font>. It's very important!
