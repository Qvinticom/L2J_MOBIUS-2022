<html><body>Prouse:<br>
Hm...Are you?.. No... I'm conducting a research, trying to create something new. I always get to meet new characters. I feel like I have seen you somewhere already.<br>
An old acquaintance can never tall you anything new. And I will never be able to create anything original if we don't talk about new things. I must invent something new! Yes! New... New...<br>
I am mumbling again, aren't I? Did you want something? <br>
I have recipes for items, but they are only availabe for characters that are of <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 85+ and have completed the 4th class change</font>. It's very important!
