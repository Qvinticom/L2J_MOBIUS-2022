I've traveled a lot before coming here. Our world is full of wonderful places! Everyone advise me to stay here, in safety, but I just can't!<br>
I want to learn everything! Isn't it great to know how to craft any item in the world?<br>
I have recipes for items, but they are only availabe for characters that are of <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 85+ and have completed the 4th class change</font>. It's very important!
