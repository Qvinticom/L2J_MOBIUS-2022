Welcome! What would you like to craft? The Black Anvil Guild spent a lot of time perfecting this recipe. I hope you don't think that a recipe is just a list of things you should do. You don't think that, right?<br>
I have recipes for items, but they are only availabe for characters that are of <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 85+ and have completed the 4th class change</font>. It's very important!
