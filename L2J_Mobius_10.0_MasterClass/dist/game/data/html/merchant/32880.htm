Ho! You look like you've been to many intersting places. I am something of a traveller myself, ho-ho. But you will probably agree that however strong your wanderlust might be, it's nice to have a place to return to.<br>
My comrades wait here while I travel around the world gathering information. Everybody has something to do.<br>
I will help you craft a useful item! <br>
I have recipes for items, but they are only availabe for characters that are of <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 85+ and have completed the 4th class change</font>. It's very important!
