Do you take interest in Fallen Angel's accessories? Fallen Angel is a spawn of Gran Kain, God of Chaos. Unfortunately, that is all I know about it.<br>
But not so long ago <font color="LEVEL">Fallen Angel accessories</font> were found. They are filled with his power. It is still unclear how these accessories could have been exposed to the power of this creature, but mystics have done some research on them and created a <font color="LEVEL">Scroll: Enchant Fallen Angel Accessories</font>. This item can be used to enchant Fallen Angel accessories.<br>
The scroll is easy to use, but it won't give you the best result of all possible. If you want you can bring <font color="LEVEL">+9 Blessed Fallen Angel's Ring</font> or <font color="LEVEL">+9 Fallen Angel's Ring</font> to me and I will seal them.<br>
