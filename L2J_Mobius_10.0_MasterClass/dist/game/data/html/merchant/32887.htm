So many people here. There is no better place to trade! But you've already heard about this from blacksmith Duning, haven't you? Here you can see bounty hunters, informants, treasure hunters and many others. Things that are not even looked at in other places, are being sold out instantly here. Well? Do not want to see the goods?<br>
I have recipes for items, but they are only availabe for characters that are of <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 85+ and have completed the 4th class change</font>. It's very important!
