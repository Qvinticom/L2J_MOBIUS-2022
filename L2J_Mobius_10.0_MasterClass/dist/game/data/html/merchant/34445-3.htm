<html><body>Accessory Artisan Denign:<br>
You can exchange a Ring of Creation for a more powerful higher-level item if you have the <font color="LEVEL">Source of the Emperor</font> that can be acquired in exchange for <font color="LEVEL">Helios's, Ramona's, Mimir's, Core's and Harnak's accessories</font>.<br>
Keep in mind, though, that the new accessories you get <font color="LEVEL">won't retain their enhancement and enchantment level.</font>. But, if all goes well, you will receive a much powerful item.<br>
