Have you heard about a brand new hair accessory?<br>
I've honed my skills by creating rare items, and now I can make a special hair accessory.<br>
In gratitude for your help, I will sell it to you only for adena.<br>
However, upgrading it will require special materials, and it won't be easy to get them.<br>
