Hush! Be quiet! I'm listening to the whispers of the flames. I feel like I'm close to tears from their warm whisper. It is heard so clearly if you bring your ear a bit closer. Others just don't know how to listen...<br>
Hm... It seems like I have been immersed in contemplation for too long. What do you want?<br>
I have recipes for items, but they are only availabe for characters that are of <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 85+ and have completed the 4th class change</font>. Just don't tell anyone!
