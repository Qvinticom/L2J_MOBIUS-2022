<html><body>Blacksmith of Mammon:<br>
May the blessing of Mammon be with you! Now our clan approves for payment adena, the world currency.<br>
Usually we remove the Shillien curse from weapon and enhanced blessed items.<br>
Besides, we can do some work that cannot be done by village blacksmiths. If you need something, just let me know.<br>
