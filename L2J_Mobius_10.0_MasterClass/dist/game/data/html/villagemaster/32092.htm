<html><body>Warehouse Chief Alder:<br>
My name is Alder. I am the Warehouse Chief of the Iron Gate Guild in Schuttgart. I don't like the chaos that now reigns in the world.<br>
We, ordinary people, live in constant fear. The day does not pass without a terrible battle somewhere.<br>
I can be sure of only one thing: if you want to live well, open your own business. And no matter what race you are.<br>
Those who understand it as well as I, want o learn from the Dwarves their business instincts and skills. So the world cannot do without us.<br>
