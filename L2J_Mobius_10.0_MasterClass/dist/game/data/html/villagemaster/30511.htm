<html><body>Warehouse Chief Gesto:<br>
My name is Gesto. I am the Warehouse Chief of Giran's Iron Gate Guild. We sell everything in any place, and we trade with anyobdy who has money. Our merchants travel throughout the world, and that makes our race prosper. And that's great, don't you think so?<br>
Well, that's not what you've come here for, right? Have we met before? So, what do you need?<br>
