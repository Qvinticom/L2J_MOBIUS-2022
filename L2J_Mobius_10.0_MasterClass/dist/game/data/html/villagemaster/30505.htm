<html><body>High Prefect Drikus:<br>
I am Drikus, High Prefect by the heirship of Father of Eternal Flame Pa'agrio. I am training Orcs and dream of giving former glory back to my tribe. Young warrior, our hope that you can get back the glory of ancient times to orcs is like dying embers waiting for the wind. How can I help you?<br>
