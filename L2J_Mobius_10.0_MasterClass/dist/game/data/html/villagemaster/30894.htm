Oh, life is becoming more dangerous every day. Nowadays, you have to hire guards just to transport goods from the Giran Harbor! Because of that, prices are sure to go up. In Giran the port and the city are far away from each other, but here in Innadril you can very quickly unload goods and transport them to the market... So I think most merchants would move to us from now on!<br>
