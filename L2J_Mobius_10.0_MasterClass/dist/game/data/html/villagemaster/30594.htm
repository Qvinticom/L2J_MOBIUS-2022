<html><body>Warehouse Chief Ranspo:<br>
My name is Ranspo. I am the Warehouse Chief of Dion's Iron Gate Guild. We sell everything in any place, and we trade with anybody who has money. Our merchants travel throughout the world, and that makes our race prosper. And that's great, don't you think so?<br>
Well, that's not what you've come here for, right? Have we met before? So, what do you need?<br>
