<html><body>High Priest Franco:<br>
May the glory of Great Light be with you...<br>
I lived a long life and gained experience, so I decided to come down to this village and teach Humans.<br>
One can find those ready to convert to a true faith in every corner of the earth. The stronger their disbelief is, the more value my work has.<br>
I represent Humans here and don't want to complain. However, it's unwise to entrust such an important thing to a young girl, who knows nothing about this life.<br>
