<html><body>Grand Master Rivian:<br>
Welcome to the Elven embassy! I am Grand Master Rivian, the Elven representative in these parts.<br> 
This place looks more like my native Innadril every day. Lots of people, trading, bustling economy and even secret conspiracies...<br>
I think that there is a purpose to everything, be it the mission that the Deity sent us on or our ability to lead others. I'm sure I was sent here for a reason!<br>
