What sign would I make this month? I have to come up with a slogan that will attract many clients! Hmm... I think I have an idea...<br>
"You've earned your money with sweat and blood, risking your life in the dragon's lair! You won't give it to a complete stranger. Trust them to your best companion - the Iron Gate Guild's Warehouse!"<br>
What do you say? Do you like it? What? Too long...? Hey! What do you know about attracting clients!<br>
