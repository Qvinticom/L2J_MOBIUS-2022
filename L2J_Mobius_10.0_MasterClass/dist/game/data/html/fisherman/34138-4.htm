You need a new Agathion? I can exchange an <font color="LEVEL">Agathion Charm +10</font> for a Greater Agathion Charm.<br>
Bring me an <font color="LEVEL">Agathion Charm +10</font> to receive a charm that summons a <font color="LEVEL">Greater Agathion</font> of the same type.
You won't be able to exchange it back, so take some time to mull it over.<br><br>
I can exchange an <font color="LEVEL">Fire Dragon Agathion Charm +10</font>, 3 Dragon Essences, 1000 Crystals of Determination, 1000 Crystals of Protection and 1000 Crystals of Dawn for a <font color="LEVEL">Greater Fire Dragon Agathion Charm</font>.<br>
But I can't do the exchange if you have more than one charm of the same type in your inventory. You will have to leave all the other ones in a warehouse.<br>
And one more thing: you can exchange a Sealed Agathion Charm, you will need to remove the seal first.<br>
