Do you want to know what is <font color="LEVEL">Star Sign</font>? It's a very rare gem with a unique ability. It can imbue Seed Bracelet with immense power.<br>
But first its owner has to learn a lot about constellations of stars to know about them as much as myself. Otherwise Star Sign will be nothing more than just a funny trinket.<br>
Long time ago fishermen often sailed far away to shoreless seas for fishing. All of them were able to read the stars. Nowadays this useful skill is lost... I'm the last one who can read starry sky like a book. It's so sad... I've hope that one day I meet a fisherman who can understand stars as well. But there are days when I feel like my hope is futile...<br>
Well, dismal talking is just a waste of time, isn't it? Listen, if you find Star Sign, come back to me. I can enhanced Seed Bracelet if there are enough materials.<br>
