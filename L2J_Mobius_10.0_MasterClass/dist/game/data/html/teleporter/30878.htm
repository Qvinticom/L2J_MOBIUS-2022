From here you can travel almost anywhere. We also ship cargo, but, of course, there is a limit to what we can do. Recently we've been running a special offer... Oh, I forgot. We don't do that anymore, there's been some problems.<br>
You might've heard that the wizards of the Ivory Tower have engineered a <font color="LEVEL">brand new way to teleport</font>. Unfortunately, it's not very reliable yet, so it's not used very often.<br>
That's why I can't teleport travellers at the moment. We are working on safety, though, and actively researching new teleports. If you want to teleport somewhere, use a Scroll of Escape and <font color="LEVEL">you will move to the city</font>. Thanks you for understanding.
