<html><body>Gatekeeper Stanislava:<br>
Oh, hi! I'm a gatekeeper like Arisha -- we've both been dispatched to help with teleportation within Rune in case of emergency, since it's such a big town.<br>
Did you see Arisha out there? I'm nice and cozy in here, but she ends up having to endure all kinds of weather. Poor Arisha. <br>
Oh, anyway. Did you need to go somewhere? Front of the temple?<br>
(Characters whose <font color="LEVEL">main class level is 1-99</font> can teleport for free.)<br>
