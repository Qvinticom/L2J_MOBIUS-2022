<html><body>Gatekeeper Valentina:<br>
Greetings! I'm Gatekeeper Valentina. I can teleport you somewhere outside of the Ivory Tower. It is a common belief that our Tower is a den of madmen who think only of conquering the world. But there are some people here who are really trying to make the world a better place...<br>
Do you want to know more about the tower? What Gatekeeper do you need?<br>
(Characters whose <font color="LEVEL">main class level is 1-99</font> can teleport for free.)<br>
