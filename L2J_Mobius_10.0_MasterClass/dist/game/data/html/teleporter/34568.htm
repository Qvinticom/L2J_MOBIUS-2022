<html><body>Patrol Teleporter:<br>
The sudden attack of the Fafurion army has had my head spinning. The first group can be found in the Field of Silence to the north trying to subjugate the Krofin.
The second one, composed of elite warriors, is setting up camp in the Field of Whispers to the south.<br>
Out scouts think that the soldiers in the Field of Whispers are more dangerous, so be extra careful.<br>
