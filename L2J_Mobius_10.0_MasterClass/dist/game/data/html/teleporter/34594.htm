<html><body>Teleporter Scout:<br>
The Platinum Tribe has taken over the 4th-6th floors of the Tower Of Insolence. They are hostile towards outsiders, so be careful.<br>
If you leave the peace zones we have set, you will enter the battlefield.<br>
In a battlefield, members of the same clan may be affected by AoE attacks.<br>
But if you are in the <font color="LEVEL">same party or alliance</font>, you won't be affected by AoE attacks of party members/alliance members. Keep this in mind.<br>
Which floor would you like to go to?<br>
