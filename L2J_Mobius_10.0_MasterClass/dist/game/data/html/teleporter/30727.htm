Hello, seeker of knowledge. Welcome to the Ivory Tower! I'm the Gatekeeper Verona.<br>
The Ivory Tower has several levels. To teleport on the next level you need to talk to us, gatekeepers.<br>
Now you're on the first level, in the lobby. On the first floor you can find the merchants' row. The guild of Human Wizards is on the second floor, the Elven Mystic Guild is on the third, and the Dark Mystic Guild is on the fourth. Where would you like to go?<br>
