<html><body>Gatekeeper Esmeralda:<br>
The outskirts of the Hunters Village are swarming with monsters. But if you use my teleport, you won't have to deal with them!<br>
Would you like to return to your home village? Maybe a friend is waiting for you somewhere? Or how about a friend is waiting for you somewhere? Or how about a vacation by the seaside? Wherever you want to go, we, Gatekeepers, will always be happy to help you.<br>
(Characters whose <font color="LEVEL">main class level is 1-99</font> can teleport for free.)<br>
