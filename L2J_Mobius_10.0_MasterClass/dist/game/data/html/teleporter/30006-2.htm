The Airship Dock is where the airships that go to <font color="LEVEL">Gracia</font> come in. However, with the invasion of Embryo in Gracia, both the dock and the route have been blocked. If you want to go to Gracia, just let me know and I'll take you to the Keucereus Alliance Base.<br>
If you would like to go to the dock, I can teleport you there.<br>
