<html><body>Gatekeeper Minerva:<br>
Hardin's Academy is not to be trifled with. I hope you know what kind of people Necromancers are? They see human flesh and blood as an ingredient for their goals. Their apathy toward death is truly disturbing.<br>
Are you scared? I understand you want to leave right now. But I can't open the Gates of Time and Space.<br>
They found a <font color="LEVEL">new way to teleport</font> at the Ivory Tower, but they are still trying to stabilize it, so I can only open the Gates of Time and Space in <font color="LEVEL">limited places</font>. If you want to leave this place right now, try using a <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Escape</font>. You should be able to go to the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Giran</font>.<br>
