Do you know Gludio's history? Here our Lord lives.<br>
Previously there were ruins of ancient Giants, but wise Cadmus, fearing the attack from Gracia, ordered to build a castle on their place.<br>
He was right, as several years ago Gracia's armies really invaded these lands. And, though few in number, Gludio's defenders managed to repel all enemy's attacks. All thanks to our king's shrewdness.<br>
