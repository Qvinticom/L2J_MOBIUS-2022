Have you ever been to Gludio? One of my cousins says that he served there in the past as a mercenary, but he generally says a lot of things...<br>
What was his name?... Allegedly, there is a wasteland southward of, and there is a cave where giant carnivorous ants live. Can you, for example, believe in it? Hahaha! Cousin should be spinning fairy tales and not go to the mercenaries!<br>
