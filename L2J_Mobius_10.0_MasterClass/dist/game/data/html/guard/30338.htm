Welcome to the most beautiful city in the whole kingdom! Once it was destroyed in the war, but thanks to the active reconstruction carried out by the Lord, it was practically restored to the former glory. Our citizens have become much more joyful and active.<br>
I wish you a pleasant stay! Just disturb anyone!<br>
