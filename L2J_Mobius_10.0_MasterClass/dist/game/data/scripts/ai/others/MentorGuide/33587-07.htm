<font color="LEVEL">1. The mentor buff is called Mentee's Appreciation</font>.<br1>
It grants acquired XP/ SP +5% to the mentor. Applied only when mentee is logged in.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">2. The mentee buff</font>.<br1>
A mentee taught by a mentor gets 4 buffs of Melody, 3 buffs of Sonatas and 1 buff of Harmony. The buffs are activated when the mentor is logged in and remain 5 min. after his/ her log out.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">3. The buff that summons mentor and enhances mentee's stats</font>.<br1>
Being a mentor you can teach your mentee useful skills.<br>
However, it's very difficult to teach somebody if you are too far away. And so the mentee is granted a skill that allows them to teleport their mentor to themselves.<br>
Mentee's Mentor Summon and Mentor's Art of Seduction can be found in the skill window, in the Clan/ Hero/ Mentorship Skills section.<br>
