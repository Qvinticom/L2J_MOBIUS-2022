<html><body>Mentor Guide:<br>
A mentor can take up to 3 mentees. Every time when a mentee levels up, their mentor gets <font color="LEVEL">Mentee's Marks</font> by mail. These marks can be traded for valuable items.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">[The amount of Mentee's Marks for reaching different levels]</font><br1>
Lv. 85: 5000 <br1>
Lv. 99: 10,000 <br1>
Lv. 103: 25,000 <br1>
Lv. 105: 60,000 <br>
After taking your marks from a letter, don't forget to delete it. If your mailbox is full, you won't be able to receive new items.<br>
If both the Mentor and the Mentee are playing at the same time, the former receives <font color="LEVEL">powerful buffs</font> while the latter <font color="LEVEL">gets a bonus to acquired XP/SP</font>.<br>
