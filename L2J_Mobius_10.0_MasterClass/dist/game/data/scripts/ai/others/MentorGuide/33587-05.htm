<html><body>Mentor Guide:<br>
You can offer another character to be their Mentor by opening the <font color="LEVEL">Friend Manager<font> and pressing the <font color="LEVEL">+ button<font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Mentorship<font> tab.<br>

For example, after becoming a Mentor in the Mentorship tab you can choose characters that would be your Mentees.<br>

Not every character can become a Mentor or a Mentee. A character can only become a <font color="LEVEL">Mentor<font> if they had already gone through <font color="LEVEL">Awakening<font> and reached <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 105<font>. A potential <font color="LEVEL">Mentee can't be higher that Lv.104<font>.<br1>
After a Mentee finishes their Mentor can't take on new Mentees for a day. After discontinuing Mentorship for some other reason, a Mentor can't take on new Mentees for two days.<br>
