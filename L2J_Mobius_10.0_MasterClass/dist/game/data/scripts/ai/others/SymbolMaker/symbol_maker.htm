Hello! Nice day, isn't it?<br>
Oh, do you wish to make a tattoo?<br1>
Hm... Do you have good dye? No? Then, please, take a loot at what i have, you will find something to your taste, I am sure.<br>
Well, it's not that easy.<br>
So, what do you think? You must exactly know what you want since it's not cheap.<br>
To choose the right tattoo is like choosing a good sword or a shield! Ha-ha!<br>
