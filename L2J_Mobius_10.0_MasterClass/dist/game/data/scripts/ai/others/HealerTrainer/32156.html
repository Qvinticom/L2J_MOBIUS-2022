Welcome! People who live by the sword are all tied together.<br>
Never forget it! The ties of this camaraderie will never be broken! Whatever happens, whoever you meet in your travels, the feeling of camaraderie should never leave you! Commit to this idea and you will find strength fighting the malevolence and disarray of the world. My students sometimes forget about this... They are great fighters, but that is not enough... They forget about people who surround them, and that's terrible!<br>
