Basically, to earn the qualifications to become an Orc Raider, your level must be at least 20, and you must pass the Test of the Orc Raider.<br>
To take the Test of the Orc Raider, go to <font color="LEVEL">Prefect Karukia of the Orc Village</font>. She will tell you everything you need to know. If you pass the test and come back, I will change your class. To get to the Orc Village, first go to Gludio, then use a Gatekeeper.<br>
