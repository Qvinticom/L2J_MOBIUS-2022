Looking for a Dragon Shirt that is infused with the power of dragons? If you bring me <font color="LEVEL">Einhasad, Melee Reflect, Reflect Magic T-shirt at +7 and above,</font> and I'll exchange it for a Dragon Shirt.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Additional 5 billion Adena required for +7 T-shirt,</font> and <font color="LEVEL">+8 T-shirt can be exchanged to Dragon Shirt for free.</font><br>
If you bring a <font color="LEVEL">+9 T-shirt</font>, I'll exchange it for a <font color="LEVEL">Dragon Leather Shirt</font>, which is better then Dragon Shirt. And if you bring <font color="LEVEL">+10 T-shirt</font>, I'll give you <font color="LEVEL">Radiant Rind Upgrade Stone</font> along with the Dragon Leather Shirt.<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Radiant Rind Upgrade Stone is an essential ingredient for upgrading the Dragon Leather Shirt.</font> Don't miss the opportunity to upgrade the shirt to a stronger one. <br>
In addition, I also exchange the Blessed Dragon Shirt Enchant Scroll that is used to Enhance the Dragon Shirt. Keep that in mind.
