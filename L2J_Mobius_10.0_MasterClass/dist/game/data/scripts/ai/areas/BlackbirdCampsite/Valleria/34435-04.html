I installed the Soul Summon Stone to provide some stability when monsters are summoned using the Soul Quartz.<br>
Without the Soul Summon Stone, summoning with Soul Quartz alone would be very difficult and unpredictable.I personally don't require the Soul Summon Stone, but others can't summon monsters reliably without it, and I need people other than myself to be able to summon monsters so I can continue on with my research.<br>
The kingdom of Aden took interest in my research and gave me permission to install Soul Summon Stones here. This place is taken care of by the Kingdom's Royal Guard, right?<br>
