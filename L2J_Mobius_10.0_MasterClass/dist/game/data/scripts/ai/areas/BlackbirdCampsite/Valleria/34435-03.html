Do you want to know about the Soul Quartz? Its creation was pure coincidence. I just wanted to learn about the effects of Clan Shards supplied by Clans in the Aden Continent and Talismans.<br>
So I was doing some tests with Clan Shards and found out that this crystal has the power to summon souls of monsters.<br>
At first, I didn't know what I had to do to summon monsters with Clan Shards. I was doing some tests and learned that applying magic power on shards of the same Clan will change them into a single crystal that could contain the souls of monsters. Then I had to conduct even more tests until I found out that I needed 20 crystals to make a stable crystal.<br>
And thus, the Soul Quartz.<br>
