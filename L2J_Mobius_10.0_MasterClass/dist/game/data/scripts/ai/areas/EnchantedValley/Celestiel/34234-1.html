I see you want to teleport to some place else in the Enchanted Valley. Wherever you end up in the Enchanted Valley, you should be safe.<br>
I can guarantee that, based on what I've seen until now. So you'd like to head into the depths of the Enchanted Valley? Alright, understood. I will send you there. Please note that the places I can send you may be rather more dangerous than the others. Please exercise particular caution.<br>
When you return, the Teleport Device that we Mother Tree Guardians have installed may be used. However, remember that to use the <font color="LEVEL">Mother Tree Guardians Teleport Device</font>, your <font color="LEVEL">Faction level with the Mother Tree Guardians must be 4 or higher</font>.<br>
