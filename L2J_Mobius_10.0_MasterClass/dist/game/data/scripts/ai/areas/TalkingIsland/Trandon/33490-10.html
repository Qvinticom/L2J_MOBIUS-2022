<html><body>Dual Class Certificate Manager:<br>
Learning the Dual Class Certification Skill is a great thing.<br>
That's why going back on it will burden your soul. That's why you need the special power of an herb to seal a skill that you have learned.<br>
The price of the herb is <font color="LEVEL">20 million Adena</font>. I already have the herb, so you just need to pay for it.<br>
If you cancel the certification, <font color="LEVEL">your current certification status disappears, and so do all certificates and stamps in your inventory that you haven't used yet</font>. So... what do you want to do?
