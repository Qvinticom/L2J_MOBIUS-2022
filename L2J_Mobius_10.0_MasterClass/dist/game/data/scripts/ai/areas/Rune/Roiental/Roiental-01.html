Heroes whose strength grows day after day can put their abilities to the test and ascend the renovated Throne of Heroes.<br>
If you want to challenge Goldberg, you need to be a member of a <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 7 clan</font>. To fight Mary Reed your clan needs to be at least <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 10</font>, while Tauti can only be confronted by a <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 13 clan</font>.<br>
The request to enter the Throne of Heroes can only be submitted by the clan leader of a clan member who has been granted the requisite authority.<br>
So, what would you like?<br>
