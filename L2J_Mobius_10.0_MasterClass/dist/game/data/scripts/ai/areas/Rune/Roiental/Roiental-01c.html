Heroes whose strength grows day after day can put their abilities to the test and ascend the renovated Throne of Heroes.<br>
If you want to challenge Tauti, you need to be a member of a <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 13 clan</font>.<br>
The request to enter the Throne of Heroes can only be submitted by the clan leader of a clan member who has been granted the requisite authority.<br>
So, would you like to enter?<br>
