Heroes whose strength grows day after day can put their abilities to the test and ascend the renovated Throne of Heroes.<br>

The request to enter the Throne of Heroes can only be submitted by the clan leader of a clan member who has been granted the requisite authority.<br>
So, would you like to enter?<br>
