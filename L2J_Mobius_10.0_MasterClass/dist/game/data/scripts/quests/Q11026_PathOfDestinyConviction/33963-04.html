Have you heard about Ratel?<br>
The creatures don't belong to the Material Realm, they are living in the Wind Spirit Realm. When Faeron had appeared, several Ratel were transfered to the Material Realm. Now they are wandering everywhere, and not long ago have started to attack people.<br>
We've planned so many researches, so it's hard for me to manage everything. Also since Ratel have become dangerously aggressive, researchers can't get near to them.<br>
