I assume Corrupted Energy is influencing on growlers.<br>
I've kept warch over them and almost sure I'm right.<br>
We need to study Corrupted Energy. That's why you have to kill Frear Growler, Fear Growler Evolved and Fear Growler Robust, gather the energy and bring it to me.<br>
I suppouse you dont't know where to find the creatures, so I'll teleport you to them.<br>
