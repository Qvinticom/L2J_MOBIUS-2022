This is the <font color="LEVEL">Prophecy Machine</font> of the <font color="LEVEL">ancient Ertheias</font>. Well, ate least they used it in the past when we lived in the Wind Spirit Realm.<br>
The machine help us preserve the prophecies as they appear and hand them down to future generations.<br>
It is very old, and no Ertheia was able to identify it. So I don't have much information<br>
