Kill <font color="LEVEL">Skeleton Scouts, Skeleton Archers, and Skeleton Warriors</font> . When you're done, go to <font color="LEVEL">Guard Zenath</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Agony</font>.<br>
it seems like It's even worse for her there. I will teleport you to the Skeletons, so you can proceed to the mission right away.<br>
