Breath of Death is a type of black magic. It's energy that can rise the dead. It haven't been used for a while, but it seems that's the case now.<br>
Kill <font color="LEVEL">Spartoi Soldiers and Raging Spartoi</font>, get <font color="LEVEL">Breath of Death</font> from their remnants. If they are indeed influenced by that magic, it will leave traces on their bones.<br>
I will teleport you to the place you need, don't waste time.<br>
By the way, if you aren't familiar with <font color="LEVEL">potion auto-use</font> function, please, look into Help menu. It is a very useful thing, I assure you.<br>
