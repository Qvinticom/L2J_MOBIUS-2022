Buffs are magic that helps you during combat. They increase the damage and speed of your physical and magical attacks, decrease damage from standard attacks and magic and favorably affect other stats.<br>
You can get buffs through the <font color="LEVEL">Adventurers' Guide</font> in towns. You can also gain friends who specialize in buffs and ask them for help. Right now for the purposes of our training I will give you a buff.<br>
That's it! It looks like you are ready to start your training! Should we begin? I know just the right place. You need to defeat monsters knowns as <font color="LEVEL">Nasty Eye and Nasty Buggle. 15</font> monsters should be enought. It's pretty simple. Once you're done find Guard Silvan. Good luck!<br>
