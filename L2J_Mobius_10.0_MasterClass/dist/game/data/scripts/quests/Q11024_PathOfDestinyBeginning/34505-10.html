That's it! It looks like you are ready to start your training! Should we begin?<br>
I know just the right place. You need to defeat monsters knowns as <font color="LEVEL">Nasty Eye and Nasty Buggle. 15</font> monsters should be enought. It's pretty simple.<br> 
Once you're done find Guard Silvan. Good luck!<br>
