That's it! I will tell you about the <font color="LEVEL">Soulshots.</font> These items contain the power of souls. When you use <font color="LEVEL">Soulshots, your weapon starts shining and deals serious damage.</font> They are very important items that are incredibly useful when attacking with standard weapons.<br>
If you have soulshot in your <font color="LEVEL">Inventory,</font> they <font color="LEVEL">will automatically move to the shortcut slot and activate.</font> Click the slot with the right mouse button If you decide not to use them.<br>
There also exist <font color="LEVEL">Spiritshots,</font> they <font color="LEVEL">increase the power of magic.</font> If you want your magic spells to be highly effective, use spiritshots.<br>
Okey, consider Soulshots covered. Now you'll need <font color="LEVEL">buffs</font>... Have you heard of them?<br>
