Simple. You have to kill monsters on the <font color="LEVEL">War-Torn Plains</font>. They drop <font color="LEVEL">Hot Energy</font>, so 
bring me <font color="LEVEL">1000 of them</font> as proof of your victory. You can also get the items from monsters of the <font color="LEVEL">Blasing Swamp</font>.<br>
During this quest you have to <font color="LEVEL">reach Lv. 100</font>.<br>
When you're done, go to Dual Class Master Joachim.<br>
Use the Teleportation cubic to return to him.
