I was able to collect the data I need thanks to you.<br>
The areas inside the refinery are divided into sectors which collect Dimensional Energy, refine them into Atelia, and convert refined Atelia into Dark Atelia.<br>
This raises another question. The flow of energy told me this much, but who is in charge of completing each process?<br>
Our final goal is the death of Etis van Etina but we still have a lot of work to do before we can achieve that.<br>
You've been a wonderful help so far but if you're willing to help us more, please talk to me after making preparations. I will tell you what must be done.<br>
