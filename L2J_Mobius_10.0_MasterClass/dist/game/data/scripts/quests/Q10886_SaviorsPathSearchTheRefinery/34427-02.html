So she really did trust you with the search in the Atelia Refinery. Then allow me to tell you a few things I found out about this place.<br>
The inside of the Atelia Refinery is divided into a few areas, but you must check something before checking each area.<br>
You must find out about the identity of <font color="LEVEL">Atelia Yuyurina</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Atelia Popobena</font> in the hallways connected to each area. I think they might be receiving orders from Etis van Etina, so I need you to collect proof from them.<br>
Use the <font color="LEVEL">Atelia Refinery Teleport Device</font> I have installed to teleport to the <font color="LEVEL">inside of Atelia Refinery</font>, hunt Atelia Yuyurina and Atelia Popobena and collect <font color="LEVEL">Tokens of Etina</font> for me.<br>
