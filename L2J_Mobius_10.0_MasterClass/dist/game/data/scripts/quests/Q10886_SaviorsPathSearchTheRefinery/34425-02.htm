When Devianne and I investigated inside the refinery, we could sense a flow of powerful energy. Without a doubt, it indicates that this place is more than just a fortress for conquering the Aden Continent.<br>
However, I have not recovered my full strength yet so I could not search the entire Atelia Refinery throughly.<br>
I am looking for someone who is strong enough to investigate this place alone. I think you're up for the task, so how about it? Can you go investigate inside?<br>
