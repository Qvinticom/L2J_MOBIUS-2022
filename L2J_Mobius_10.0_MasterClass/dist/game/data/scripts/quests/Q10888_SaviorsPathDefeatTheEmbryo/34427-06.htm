This must be Atelia in Extraction.<br>
I can sense a huge power in it although its extraction is not complete. Imagine how much power it'll hold when extraction is complete... Enough for Etis van Etina to wield the Seven Signs at the snap of a finger.<br>
And this power is even pure and more powerful than the Giants' power that could be obtained from Amaranthine.<br>
Sporcha, a member of our Blackbird Clan is at the place transporting Atelia. He is supposed to interrupt its transportation process so we could use the outlet as our own.<br>
Looks like your preparation is done as well. Go tell Leona that you're ready to bring an end to Etis van Etina. Thank you for your very hard work.<br>
