Last time we spoke Reclous told me that the Turek War Hounds that Orcs always parade around had been bothering him. I think you should kill a few Turek War Hounds before coming to Reclous.<br>
Turek War Hound are usually led by the Turek Orc Footmen. Defeat them all and them talk to Reclous. That will help you to gain his trust.<br>
Since the mainland has been quite unsafe lately, I'll send you right to your destination.<br>
