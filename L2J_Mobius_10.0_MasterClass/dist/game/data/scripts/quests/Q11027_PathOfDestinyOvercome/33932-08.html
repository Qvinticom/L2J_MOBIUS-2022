This is Atelia! A most rare gem, rare even back in the Wind Spirit Realm. It's infused with immense magic that doesn't deplete. This is my first time seeing one in person. This is... forbidden? Why did that thought come up?<br>
Hm hm. I got a bit excited there from seeing Atelia. This will help you overcome your fate and obtain new powers. You should show this to Tarti<br>
