Reclous has told me that the Turek War Hounds that the Orcs parade around had been bothering him a lot. I think you should kill a few Turek War Hounds before going to Reclous.<br>
Turek War Hound are usually led by the Turek Orc Footmen. Defeat them all and them talk to Reclous. That will help you to gain his trust.<br>
Since the mainland has been quite unsafe lately, I'll send you right to your destination.<br>
