I noticed Turek Orc Archers and Turek Orc Skirmishers running back and forth exchanging some information. If you kill these mongrels, we will disrupt the plans of their mysterious encourager. We dont't have much time, so I will teleport you straight to the place where those Turek Orc Archers and Turek Orc Skirmishers roam.<br>
