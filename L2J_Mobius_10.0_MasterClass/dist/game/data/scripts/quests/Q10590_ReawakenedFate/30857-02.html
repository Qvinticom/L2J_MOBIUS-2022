A strange energy from hunting vampires? It sounds interesting. Hm... Let's see... I see.<br>
This energy is yours. When you train in the Ertheia training method, sometimes, your current power and your latent power collide. And that was unstable during the fight against a corrupt being, so it was materialized.<br>
This is yours, so you can absorb it. Don't worry. Think of becoming one with this energy.<br>
