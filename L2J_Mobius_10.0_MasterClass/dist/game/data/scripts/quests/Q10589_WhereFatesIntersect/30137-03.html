Really? Okay. I'll calm down. Then please defeat the new monsters in the <font color="LEVEL">Altar of Evil</font> Defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Doom Soldier, Doom Servant, Doom Berserker, and Doom Seer</font> and bring me <font color="LEVEL">200</font> of the <font color="LEVEL">Undead Blood</font>.<br>
And Herphah said that if an adventurer comes, to tell them that they have to reach <font color="LEVEL">level 95</font>.<br>
Once you collect it, you can go back to Herphah. The Altar of Evil is right here, so I won't be teleporting you.<br>
