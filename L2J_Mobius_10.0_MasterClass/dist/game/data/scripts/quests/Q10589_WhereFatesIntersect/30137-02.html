Oh... Sony, I didn't mean to scream at you. But take a look around. As soon as this contaminated land was about to come back to life, new monsters started appearing and have now taken over.<br>
Actually, I had to run away from my previous post. If you don't help me, I'm dead.<br>
Please help me.<br>
