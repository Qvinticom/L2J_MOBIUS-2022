Now, go to the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Aden</font>.<br>
By the way, it's your first time outside the Town of Gludio, right? Then you'll have to take a look at the <font color="LEVEL">map</font>.<br>
You can find out a lot of things through the map. Your current location, the place where you need to go, and recommendations as well. Use it well, and you will never get lost.<br>
Anyway, go to the Town of Aden and talk to <font color="LEVEL">Herphah</font>. Ill be there too, so Ill see you there.<br>
