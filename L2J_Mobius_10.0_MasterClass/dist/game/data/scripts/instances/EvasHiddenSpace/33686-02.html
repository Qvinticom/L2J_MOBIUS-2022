The reason I'm telling you this is because you will continue to face trials where your sacrifice and devotion will be needed. But do you think that means that your path is filled with hardship and sadness? I don't think so. The path that you go is a noble path that will raise your name. Please remember what I just said. That's why I wanted to see you.<br>
That's all. Now go up and talk to <font color="LEVEL">Lionel Hunter</font>, who will give you your qualification.<br>
