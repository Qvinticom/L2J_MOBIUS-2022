I will give you Lucky Pouch to scare away any misfortunes and disasters.<br>
There are three types of Lucky Pouches: <font color="ff8c00">Growth (aquired XP/SP)</font>, <font color="ffd700"> Prosperity (aquired adena bonus)</font>, and <font color="008000">Harmony (Vitality Bonus)</font>. I will give you the pouch, which suits you the most.<br>
Oh, one more thing! If you don't need the Lucky Pouch you get, you can exchange it for another one. But you can do it only once.<br>
Remember that <font color="ff6868">exchange is only possible once for every character of Lv. 105 and higher</font>.<br>
