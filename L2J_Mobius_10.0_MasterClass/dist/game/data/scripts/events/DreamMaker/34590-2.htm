I can tell your future and give you a buff that will help you cope with any difficulties.<br>
There are 4 buffs in total. For 8 hours they can increase your Attribute Attack/Resistance by 50. Also, each of these buffs boosts your <font color="ff6868">attack</font>, <font color="6495ed">defense</font>, <font color="ff8c00">acquired XP</font> and <font color="LEVEL">luck</font>.<br>
And once in a while you can get even stronger buffs, if the fate is on your side.<br>
You can have your future told for free once a day.<br1>
After that I will give you a buff.<br>
If you don't like the buff you've got, I can alter your fate a bit and change the effect, but you will have to pay for it.<br>
So do you want to know your future and get a buff?<br>
