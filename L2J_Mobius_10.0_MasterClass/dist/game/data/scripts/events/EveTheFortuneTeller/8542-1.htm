Hello!<br>
My name is Eve, and I'm a fortune teller.<br>
If you have Tarot cards, I can use them to look into your future...<br>
Cartomancy is a mysti ritual available in the world of Elmoreden to the few chosen ones. The skill of being brave enough to look into the eyes of your fate - that's what I call a real treasure...<br>
Maybe it can bring you other riches as well? I can deal the cards for you...<br>
If Lady Luck looks at you with favour, you can get various gifts:<font color="LEVEL"> from Gemstones(R-grade) to rare epic accessories</font>. Try you fate: remember good things come to those who have the courage.<br>
So, you'll need a <font color="LEVEL">Tarot Card Coupon (you can purchase it in the L2 Store for 1,5 euro)</font>. Exchange it in my shop for a Tarot Card so I could deal the cards.<br>
When you get a card, we can begin!<br>
I wish you every success. May you always be the darling of Fortune.<br>
