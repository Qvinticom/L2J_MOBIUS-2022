<html><body>Dragon Slayer Luna:<br>
Mysterious Dragon Slayer is a very special weapon. It is imbued with energy that was first discovered in the Dragon Valley. This energy is lethal for monsters that live there.<br>
The weapon can be enchanted with <font color="LEVEL">Scroll:Enchant Mysterious Weapon</font> created from dragon relics. This is the only way to reach the weapon's true potential.<br>
Don't you want to have this power of ancient dragons? As I've said, you won't be able to get it without luck. Give it a try! And if you are successful, I'll give you a nice reward.<br>
Don't forget, the weapon can only be enchanted with <font color="LEVEL">Scroll:Enchant Mysterious Weapon</font>. No other item will do.<br>
