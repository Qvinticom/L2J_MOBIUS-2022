Every participant of the Grand Olympiad must know its rules.<br>
The Olympiad is held every week, on Fridays and Saturdays from 8:00 p.m. till 11:40 p.m.<br>
In order to become a hero at the Grand Olympiad, you must gain numerous victories. The winner is determined by the amount of damage dealt. Damage inflicted on a pet has no effect upon the victory.<br>
The winner takes a certain amount of Olympiad Points from the loser. The number of points transferred from the loser to the winner is determined as follows: the number of points of the winner and loser is compared, and then the winner receives 1/5 of points of the smaller amount. The same amount is subtracted from the loser's score. If the result is a draw, both parties lose 1/5 of their points.<br>
The maximum number of added/subtracted points for winning/losing is 10.<br>
Olympiad Points are earned during the Olympiad season and allocated at certain intervals. At least one Olympiad Point is required to participate in the fights.<br>
