I suppose you're using the weapons and armor you were issued. That's unless you have rich friends, of course, eh?<br>
Whatever you have is fine for now. Remember to pay attention to what you find hunting monsters -- you can find armor, and sometimes even weapons, in the wild. If you're lucky, you might find <font color="LEVEL">Cloth Shoes,</font> <font color="LEVEL">Apprentice's Shoes</font> or a <font color="LEVEL">Cloth Cap.</font><br>
You should have been given two weapons, a dagger and a Squire's Sword. Perhaps you have already noticed that daggers and swords perform differently in battle. The <font color="LEVEL">dagger</font> is swift, but its accuracy suffers, while the <font color="LEVEL">Squire's Sword</font> is noticeably slower than the dagger, but strikes with greater a accuracy. Remember that differently weapons may call upon differently skills in their use. Either is a worth weapon; it is up to you to decide which suits you best.<br>
