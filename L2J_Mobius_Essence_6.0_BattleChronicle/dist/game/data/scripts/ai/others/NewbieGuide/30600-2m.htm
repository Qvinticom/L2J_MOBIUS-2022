Always keep your mind fixed on the ultimate goal! War has brought chaos to the realms of Men, and chaos is our natural element. We seek to <font color="LEVEL">make use of this chaos</font> to advance our race and bury the sun dwellers.<br>
But first things first. Begin by mastering the weapons and armor you have now. Go hunt keltirs or wolves arounds the village. When you find weapons or armor on the monsters you slay, try to use them yourself. Items which are useless to you may be sold at a shop, to finance your further adventures.<br>
