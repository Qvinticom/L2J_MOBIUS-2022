It's never too early to think about your long-term goals. Merchants like us are opportunists by nature. If you want to become rich and leave your mark on the world, then heed my advice.<br>
For now, your task is to master the arms and armor you've been given. Whether you survive to become a Bounty Hunter, collecting scales from dragons, or take the path of a Warsmith, with massive siege engines at your command, it all starts with the basics I can tell you here and now.<br>
So pratice your hunting skills on <font color="LEVEL">Longtail Keltirs,</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Gremlin Scavengers</font> aroung the village. When you find items left behind by your prey, try equipping the weapons and armor to see if they're better than what you've already got. As for the rest, if you have no use for it you can always sell it at the shop for pocket money.<br>
