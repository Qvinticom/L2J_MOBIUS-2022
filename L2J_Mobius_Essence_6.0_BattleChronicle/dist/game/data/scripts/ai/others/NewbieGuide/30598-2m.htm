It's never too early to think about your long-term goals. Now you are merly a novice Fighter, but if you train hard and learn much, there is nothing to stop you from becoming a alor or a king.<br>
You must begin by familiarizing yourself with the gear you already have. Whether you seek to become a Dragon Slayer or the lord of a castle, or even a force for world peace, it all begins with your trainning here.<br>
Start out by hunting Keltirs or Wolves around the village. When you find items left behind by monsters you slay, try equipping the armor and weapons, and see if they're better than what you already have. If you have no other use for them, you can always sell them at a shop.<br>
