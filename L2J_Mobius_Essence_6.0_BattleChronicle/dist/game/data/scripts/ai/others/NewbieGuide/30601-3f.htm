Unless your friend are rich and generous, I suppose you're still using the weapons and armor you were given by the guilds?<br>
For now, whatever you have will do. After defeating monsters, you'll often find armor they left behind. Sometimes weapons,too. If you're lucky, you may get your hand on <font color="LEVEL">Cloth Shoes,</font> <font color="LEVEL">Apprentice's Shoes,</font> <font color="LEVEL">or a Cloth Cap.</font> as hunting spoils.<br>
Your guild will have issued you two weapons to start with: a Dagger and a Guild Member's Club. I hope you've figured out the different. Ha! The <font color="LEVEL">dagger</font> is swift, and has a good chance to do critical damage, while a <font color="LEVEL">club (blunt)</font> is much slower, but is more likely to score a hit. Remember, the weapons you choose to carry will affect the skills you can get.<br>
