For now, go out and hunt <font color="LEVEL">Crimson Keltirs, Elder keltirs,</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Kasha Wolves</font> northwest of the village. Wolves are the most dangerous, so watch out. Leave the village by the north or south gate and climb down the hill. You can't miss them.<br>
And I warn you, don't try to tangle with the goblins at Lv.3 to 4. Goblins are smarter and stronger than you think, but the most dangerous thing is that they know about teamwork -- if you attack one, several others may come to its aid. Even if you might have a chance against a single goblin, you won't be able to stand against two or three. Steer completely clear of goblins until you reach Lv.6 or above.<br>
