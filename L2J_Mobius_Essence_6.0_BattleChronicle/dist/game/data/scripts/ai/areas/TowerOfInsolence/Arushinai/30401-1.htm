Baium spent hundreds of years imprisoned. He was forced to watch how slowly his empire died... 
Baium's anger was so great that the <font color="LEVEL">Heavenly Rift</font> itself began yo change under his influence. 
I'll give you a little clue... So that you can imagine what can happen in the fault. 
Or you will be attacked by <font color="LEVEL">40 Divine Angels</font> (kill them as soon as you notice), 
or the will be <font color="LEVEL">20 Bombs</font> (their explosions will summon the Divine Angels, who will also have to be killed). 
And be careful: from an exploding bomb can drop anything valuable! Either you need <font color="LEVEL">to protect the Tower</font> from 20 Divine Angels who will try to destroy it. 
If you do this, you will receive a reward. Be extremely attentive!<br>
Fight shoulder to shoulder with you members. And remember: if you leave the Heavenly Rift before the due time, you can not return here. 
Gather with strength - and go!<br>
