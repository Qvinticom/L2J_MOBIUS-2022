Have you heard what happened in the Orc Barracks? Blood-thirsty Orcs built a settlement that would unite their tribesmen. There is no better place to hone your skills. But be careful, elite Orc Warriors might be roaming the area.<br>
I'll walk you through it. There is a special restricted area where you can go only enter once per 24 hours. If you want to go there again, you will have to pay a lot of money. Remember, it's not you regular Hunting Zone. Monsters are really tough there, but if you manage to defeat them, you will be handsomely rewarded.<br>
