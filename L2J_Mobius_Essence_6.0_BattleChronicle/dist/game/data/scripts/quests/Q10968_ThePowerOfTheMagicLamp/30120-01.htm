To tell the truth, I myself have never seen it. But I know it can be obtained by adventurers while they are killing monsters.<br>
By doing that, you charge the Magic Lamp bar, and when it is full, you can play a game. By the way, is that a Magic Lantern in your hands?<br>
You can get XP and SP depending on the game results. Though I can be mistaken, because I rarely leave the temple, and my knowledge of the outside world is rather limited.<br>
Is the old days you would get a Lantern after playing the game and then use it to gain XP and SP. But the Ivory Tower Wizards used Dwarven research to upgrade the technology and noow you get XP and SP directly.<br>
