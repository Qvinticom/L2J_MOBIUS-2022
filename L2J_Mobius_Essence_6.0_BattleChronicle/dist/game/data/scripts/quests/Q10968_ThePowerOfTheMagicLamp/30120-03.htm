One more thing! It's very easy to charge the Magic Lamp bar. It pretty much charges itself when you kill monsters and gain XP.<br>
The Magic Lamp games have four levels. Characters who have reaced Lv.76 can play the very best Magic Lamp games. If you are not that strong yet, I wish you luck with the first level game.<br>
In the meantime I will prepare a very useful gift for you. We'll talk again once we are done.<br>
One more thing! I see you're trying to think of a good place to go fight monsters? I know of a curious place, but I doubt it would be wise for you to go there just yet. If you have a <font color="LEVEL">Blue Lantern</font> in your inventory, <font color="LEVEL">use</font> it and come talk to me gain.<br>
