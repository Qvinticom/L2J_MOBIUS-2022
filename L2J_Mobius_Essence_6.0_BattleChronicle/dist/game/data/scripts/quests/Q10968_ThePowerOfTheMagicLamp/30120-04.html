One more thing! I've been waiting for you. And so has my gift.<br>
Have you tired to play the Magic Lamp game? Don't worry if you haven't. The Magic Lamp bar is probably almost full.<br>
When the Magic Lamp is full, it can't store any more energy, no matter how many more monsters you kill. So don't hesitate to play the game once the lamp is full.<br>
Remember that you can play a maximum of 300 games before the Magic Lamp becomes empty.<br>
