I am very fascinated by the Magic Lamp and the way it grants XP and SP. It's a true miracle that resembles divine blessing. It makes me so sad to realise that I will never get to experience it myself... A capable warrior I am not.<br>
You, however, look more than worthy of this marvel. Why don't you charge the Magic Lamp bar and give the game a go once you have a chance?<br>
