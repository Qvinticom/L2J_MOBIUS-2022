<html><body>Head Trainer Kilremange:<br>
The world has changed a lot. Now we can automatically look for and fight enemies. I'm talking about a new function called <font color="LEVEL">Automatic Hunting</font>. I suggest you master it.<br>
when the <font color="LEVEL">Automatic Hunting</font> is on, you will easily find enemies and attack them. I recommend you use <font color="LEVEL">Automatic Hunting</font> to defeat Skeleton Archers and Skeleton Warriors that inhabit the first training grounds.<br>
It's not far from here but I can teleport you there if you don't want to waste time.<br>
