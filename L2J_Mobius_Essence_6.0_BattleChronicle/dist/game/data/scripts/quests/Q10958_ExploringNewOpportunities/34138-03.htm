There are quite a few Skeletons not far from here. Some of them used to be my friends, we tried to put the Fire Dragon to rest together. Unfortunately the dragon bested them.<br>
They were cursed, but their fate is different from ours. They were turned into monsters.<br>
Anyway, that's not really all that important. When you fight them, be sure to check the new way of hunting that wasn't available before.<br>
