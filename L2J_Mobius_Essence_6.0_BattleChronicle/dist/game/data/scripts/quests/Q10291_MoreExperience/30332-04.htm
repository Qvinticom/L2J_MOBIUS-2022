The most important thing is: do not be in haste. To achieve success you have to make efforts. That's correct for whatever you do.<br>
If you want to get the best result, you shouldn't waste your time. At the same time, undue hurry can do a lot of ham. When you are practicing, you should do everything unhurriedly and persistently.<br>
I suppose the <font color="LEVEL">Abandoned Camp</font> is the best place for your training. If you're strong enough, you can deal with the creatures living there.<br>
You can get to the Abandoned Camp by using <font color="LEVEL">teleport</font> tranfering to <font color="LEVEL">Gludin hunting zones</font>, so it's not a problem to get there.<br>
Good luck!<br>
