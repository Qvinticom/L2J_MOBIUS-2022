That's right. A lot of creatures created by Giants are roaming there. Giant's legacy, if I may call them so.<br>
Long ago the Giants were their masters, but now the creatures serve nobody and nobody can keep them at bay. They have alot their memories and turned into monsters attacking anyone who doesn't look like a Giant.<br>
If we sit back and do nothing, these monster will spread out over the would. So go to the <font color="LEVEL">Siilen Valley</font> and kill <font color="LEVEL">1000 monsters</font> there. Please hunt down every <font color="LEVEL">Creature of the Past, Forgotten Face, Giant's Shadow, Warrior of Ancient Times, Shaman of Ancient Times, and Forgotten Ancient Creature</font> that you see.<br>
