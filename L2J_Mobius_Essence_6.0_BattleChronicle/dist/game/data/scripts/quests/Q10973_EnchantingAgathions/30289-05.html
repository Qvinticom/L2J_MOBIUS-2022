Great! But you should know one more thing. Adventurer's Agathion - Griffin is an agathion for newbie adventurer's, so it can be enchanted to +1 only. Other agathions can become much stronger.<br>
However, when you enchant agathion to +4 and higher there is a chance to fail enchanting, in that case the agathion disappears.
