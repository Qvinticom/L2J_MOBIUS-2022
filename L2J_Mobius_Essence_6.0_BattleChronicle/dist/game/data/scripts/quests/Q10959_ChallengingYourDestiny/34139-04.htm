You know it already. The best way to train is to battle monsters. It makes your body and spirit stronger and lets you overcome your fate.<br>
You have yet to understand it, though.<br>
Anyway, at this point your main goal is to become stronger. To do this, visit <font color="LEVEL">the second training grounds</font> and destroy <font color="LEVEL">Skeleton Scouts</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Skeleton Hunters</font> there. Bring eternal peace to these poor creatures who will never become Death Knights.<br>
If you're ready to go immediately, I can teleport you there.<br>
