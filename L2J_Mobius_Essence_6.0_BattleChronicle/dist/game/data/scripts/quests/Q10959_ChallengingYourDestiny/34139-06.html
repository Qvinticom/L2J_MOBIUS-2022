<html><body>Quartermaster Mathorn:<br>
The main gift is the experience you gained.<br>
You trained well and reached <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 20</font>. Now you are ready to change class. If you change <font color="LEVEL">class</font> and become a <font color="LEVEL">Death Blade</font>, your strength will grow. So remember my words.<br>
Now the time has come for you to leave the Death Knight base and heed the call to adventure. Don't forget about <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Ore, HP Potions and XP Growth Scrolls</font>.<br>
You will need all these things in future battles.<br>
By the way, Captain Bathis from Gludio really wants to talk to you. Are you ready to meet him?<br>
