If you need some guidance, talk to a <font color="LEVEL">Gatekeeper</font>. They'll tell you where you need to go to improve your skills.<br>
We have a <font color="LEVEL">Gatekeeper</font> in Wind Village as well.<br>
Talk to <font color="LEVEL">Gatekeeper Mellos</font> or find <font color="LEVEL">Gatekeeper Bella</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Gludio</font>.<br>
If you want to go straight to Gludio's Gatekeeper, I can send you there right now.<br>
