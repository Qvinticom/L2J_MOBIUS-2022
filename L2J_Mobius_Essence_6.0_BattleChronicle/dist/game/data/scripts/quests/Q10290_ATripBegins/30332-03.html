To mark your advancements I'm going to give you a small present. It'll help you to become stronger.<br>
And if you have a <font color="LEVEL">Weapon of Aden</font> use the <font color="LEVEL">Scroll: Enchant Weapon of Aden</font> to make it <font color="LEVEL">better</font>.<br>
There's one more thing I'd like to give you. Here, take it. It's a special bracelet. The path you're on is a dangerous one and items like this can save your life.<br>
If you want I can tell you more about bracelets. Are you interested?<br>
