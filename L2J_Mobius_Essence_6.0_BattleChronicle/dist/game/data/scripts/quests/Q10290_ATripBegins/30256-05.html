Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Agony</font>. You can get there using teleportation. To travel there use the <font color="LEVEL">teleport</font> to <font color="LEVEL">Gludio</font> from the <font color="LEVEL">list of hunting zone teleports</font>.<br>
I think this place is not dangerous for you.<br>
Nobody has been living there for a long time, just beasts. I suppose good hunting will benefit you: you'll try out and improve your skills.
