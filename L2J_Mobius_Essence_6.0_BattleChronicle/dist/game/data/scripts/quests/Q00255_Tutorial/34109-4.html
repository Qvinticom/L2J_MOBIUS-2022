<html><head><body>Elder Ragnir:<br>
Jin Kamaels were created by the Giants, but we escaped to not live for the Giants.<br>
A long time passed since we started living in seclusion, and the world has changed. Now we can live as a race of our own.<br>
We erased the pain of the past as you awoke from the deep sleep, but if you remember anything painful, don't dwell on it, and enjoy the new life.<br>
You no longer need to come to this place. Go out into the world. I'll send you to the Newbie Guide. Experience all there is to life.<br>
