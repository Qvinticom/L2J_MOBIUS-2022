<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br>
Go to the Sea of Spores and defeat monsters.<br>
But before you go there, think about <font color="LEVEL">obtaining a good equipment.</font><br>
To get to the Sea of Spores use a <font color="LEVEL">teleport</font>. The nearest one is placed in <font color="LEVEL">Oren</font>. Also you can use a <font color="LEVEL">scroll for teleporting to the Sea of Spores</font>. I know you have one in your inventory.<br>
By the way, monsters living in the Sea of Spores are bound to water attribute, so you'd better use <font color="LEVEL">wind attribute</font> against them. I hope it's useful information.<br>
