<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br>
Yes... I know you are brave and strong warrior, not a newbie. People from the places where you are famed for your heroic deeds have spread news about it.<br>
You've achieved many victories but to get stronger you have to defeat more dangerous enemies in more dangerous places. I've mind one such place.<br>
I'm talking about the <font color="LEVEL">Sea of Spores</font>. That's a very good place to improve your skills and grow stronger.<br>
You can get to the Sea of Spores using <font color="LEVEL">teleport</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Oren</font>. I suppose a mighty warrior such as you can survive in this horrible place.<br>
