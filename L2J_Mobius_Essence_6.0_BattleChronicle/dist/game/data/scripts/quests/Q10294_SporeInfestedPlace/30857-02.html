The Sea of Spores is surrounded by a special barrier that prevents its spreading.<br>
I recommend you go there and pratice your skills fighting monsters. It will toughen you up before you go to other places. I'd recommend you start your journey after you've reached <font color="LEVEL">Lv.44</font>.<br>
When you've gained enough experience and strength, I'll tell you where you should go next.<br>
