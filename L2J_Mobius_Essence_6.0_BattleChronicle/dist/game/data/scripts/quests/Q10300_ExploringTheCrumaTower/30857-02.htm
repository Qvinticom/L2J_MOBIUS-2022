The Cruma Tower in the land of Dion is one of Giant's creations.<br>
Ivory Tower Wizards have a theory that Giants was planning to build an unique tower that would generate energy. But it's just a theory, there are not enough proofs, that's why the Cruma Tower is a study object.<br>
By the way, I think the wizards would be happy if someone helps them to explore the Cruma Tower.<br>
