<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br>
The Cruma Tower war built by Giants who ruled all the continent.<br>
The tower isn't explored enough, so many different dangers may await you there. That's why only experienced warriors can go that place.<br1>
Unfortunately, you are not strong, so come back later.<br>
(Available to characters of Lv. 65 and higher.)<br>
