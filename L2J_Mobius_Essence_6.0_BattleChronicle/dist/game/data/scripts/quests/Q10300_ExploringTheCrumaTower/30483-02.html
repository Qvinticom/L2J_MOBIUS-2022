<html><body>Ivory Tower Wizard Carsus:<br>
Recently Ivory Tower Wizards have decided to explore the lower levels of the Cruma Tower, but after getting there they have faced many monsters. It's pretty hard to explore something during fighting.<br>
So I was told to look for adventurers who can help our scholars and kill the monster in the <font color="LEVEL">Cruma Tower</font>.<br>
If you want to help us, go to the <font color="LEVEL">2nd and 3rd floors</font> of the Cruma Tower and kill <font color="LEVEL">1000 monsters</font> there.<br>
