<html><body>Pet Manager Lemper:<br>
There are six types of pets. They gain XP together with their owner and can evole when they reach a certain point. Both of these things are very important as they let the pet be of more help to the owner.<br>
Unfortunately, the Pet Manager Association couldn't save all the missing creatures. Me and Pet Manager Cooper managed to rescue only two pets. Soon after that I joined the Association.<br>
You see, the creatures were not running away, they were being stolen. Cooper and I, we tracked the petnapper down and fought him for the pets. I covered Cooper while he was on the frontline. I think he got a good look at the petnapper and generally know more about this than me.<br>
Talk to Cooper to learn more. Say hi from me and tell that I live in Aden now.<br>
