Oh! Have you met Lemper?<br>
How's he doing? Getting used to living in Aden? We got really close when we both went after the petnapper and II was able to save my pet.<br>
I used to think pets were just a way to make money, you know? But after that night everything changed. It's such a pity we couldn't save the others.<br>
