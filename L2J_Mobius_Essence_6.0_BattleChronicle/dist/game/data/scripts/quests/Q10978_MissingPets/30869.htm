<html><body>Pet Manager Lemper:<br>
The Pet Manager Association has organized an extensive search and rescue mission to find the missing pets and we were able to find some of them.<br>
The time spent without their owners has had an effect on the pets. That's what got me interested in the first place, but I also wanted to help return the pets to their owners. So I decided to join the Pet Manager Association and since then I've learned a lot about pets.<br>
