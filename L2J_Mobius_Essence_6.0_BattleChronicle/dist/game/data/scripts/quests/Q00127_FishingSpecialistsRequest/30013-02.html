Thank you a lot!<br>
There are some gossips that dirty water from the northwestern part of the Alligator Island kills all the fish. I'm afraid that these gossips might be true. It is of crucial importance to check everything and find out what is happening. My friend <font color="LEVEL">Farm</font> is fishing in those lands. It's far away from here, to reach the place you need to cross the sea. But I can relocate you.<br>
