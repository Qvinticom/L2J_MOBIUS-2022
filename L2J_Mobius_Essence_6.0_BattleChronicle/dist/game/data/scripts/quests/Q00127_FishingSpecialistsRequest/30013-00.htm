<html><body>Fishing Specialist Pierre:<br>
For me fishing is the best way to have a rest. It helps me to relax, to forget about mortal coil, gives you peace of mind. However, it might end soon. There are some gossips that dirty water from the northwestern part of the Alligator Island kills all the fish. I'm afraid that these gossips might be true... Will you help me to deal with this problem and allay my anxiety?<br>
