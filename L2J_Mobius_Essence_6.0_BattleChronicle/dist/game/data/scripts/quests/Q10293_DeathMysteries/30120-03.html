<html><body>High Priest Maximillian:<br>
You have to explore Death Pass. It's called like that not for nothing. Many brave warriors had met their deaths there. Another problem is that the Dragon Valley where dreadful Antharas lives neighbours upon the Death Pass.<br>
There's a rumour that Antharas has been acting in a strange way lately. We must be sure he is not controlling the monsters living in nearby areas.<br>
That's the reason why I'm asking you to go to the Death Pass. You have to kill monsters inhabiting there and test the waters.
