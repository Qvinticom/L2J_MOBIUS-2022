<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br>
You have to remember something <font color="LEVEL">very important</font>.<br>
As soon as you've spoken to Grand Master, <font color="LEVEL">many monsters appear</font>.<br>
Be ready to fight.<br>
Besides you have to remember that <font color="LEVEL">transcendent powers can be used only in transcendent instance zones</font>. If you leave the transcendent instance zone, you lose the powers.<br>
Go to the transcendent instance zone of your level and fight monsters dwelling there.<br>
It will make you stronger.<br>
