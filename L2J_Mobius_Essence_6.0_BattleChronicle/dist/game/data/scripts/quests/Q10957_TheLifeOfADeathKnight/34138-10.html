<html><body>Head Trainer Kilremange:<br>
I'm very kind. I'll grant you a special buff that will be very useful during your training. And in case you might forget what a <font color="LEVEL">Death Knight</font> looks like, I'll turn you into an <font color="LEVEL">Ultimate Death Knight</font>.<br>
When hunting, always keep track of your <font color="LEVEL">DP</font> value. You can check it under your DP bar. If it passes 100 points, the <font color="LEVEL">Devastating Mind</font> effect will appear. Don't forget that <font color="LEVEL">it's connected to the Death Points</font>.<br>
Your training can be quite dangerous, so take a few <font color="LEVEL">HP Potions</font> with you and set them to <font color="LEVEL">auto-use</font>. By the way, take some SoulShots. If you happen to find a <font color="LEVEL">Soulshot Ticket</font>, you can exchange it for Spiritshots or Soulshots through the <font color="LEVEL">Game Assistant</font>.
So, are you ready for your next training session?<br>
