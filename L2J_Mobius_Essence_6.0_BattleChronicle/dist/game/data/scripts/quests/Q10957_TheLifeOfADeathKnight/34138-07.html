First I'll give you Soulshots.<br>
You'll equip them automatically if you have a weapon.<br>
Remember that there also exist Spiritshots that make your magic more powerful.<br>
Here take these SoulShots and see how useful they are for yourself.<br>
There you go! Destroy the Training Dummy once more, but this time use the equipped Soulshots.
