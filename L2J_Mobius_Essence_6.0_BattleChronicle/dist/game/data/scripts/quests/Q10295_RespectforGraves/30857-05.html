<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br>
One day you'll become a glorious warrior, no doubt.<br>
But you shouldn't let the grass grow under your feet. You have to fight worthy enemies to become stronger.<br>
Now I recommend you go to the <font color="LEVEL">Fields of Massacre</font>. However, if you are not that sure in yourself, the <font color="LEVEL">Plains of Glory</font> or <font color="LEVEL">War-Torn Plains</font> would also be good choice for training.<br>
By the way, I have to tell you about <font color="LEVEL">craft points</font>. You can get them by killing monsters. When you collect the required amount, you can <font color="LEVEL">create a random item</font>. So make efforts.<br>
Also, there's one thing that can help you in crafting. It is called <font color="LEVEL">Asofe</font>. It increases the amount of craft points gained, so why don't you try it? May Einhasad bless you.
