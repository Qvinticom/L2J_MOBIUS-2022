Go to the Gorgon Flower Garden and explore it carefully, I'm sure you'll find there something suspicious. Also kill <font color="LEVEL">Harpies, Medusas, Wyrms, Turak Bugbears, Turak Bugbear Warriors and Amber Basilisks</font>.<br>
But be careful. You can meet the <font color="LEVEL">Harpy Matriarch</font> there, and it's a very dangerous enemy.<br>
You can reach the Gorgon Flower Garden through the teleport which can be found on the teleport page of Giran.<br>
The mission is very dangerous but I've heard about you power, so I've no doubt that you will do what should be done. May Einhasad bless you.
