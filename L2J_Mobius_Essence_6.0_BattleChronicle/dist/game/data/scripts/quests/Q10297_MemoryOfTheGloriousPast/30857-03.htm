There are too many monsters wandering on the Plains of Glory.<br>
But why am I I surprised? Places of ancient battles are attracting monsters. Shattered lands are some kind of reminder of war horrors and a high price of victory.<br>
But the Plains of Glory is a special place for local people. We cannot allow monsters roaming there.<br>
Please, kill the monster that roaming the Plains of Glory. I'm talking about <font color="LEVEL">Vanor Silenos, Vanor Silenos Soldier, Vanor Silenos Scout, Vanor Silenos Warrior, Vanor Silenos Shaman, Vanor Silenos Chieftain, Vanor Mercenary of Glory</font>. You have to destroy <font color="LEVEL">500 monsters</font> in total.<br>
Also you have to <font color="LEVEL">reach Lv. 64.</font><br>
