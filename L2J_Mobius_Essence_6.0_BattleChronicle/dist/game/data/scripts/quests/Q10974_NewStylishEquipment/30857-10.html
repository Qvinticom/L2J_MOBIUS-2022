Good. I'm glad that I could help you at early stages. Of course, that's the will of Einhasad and our lord, but I'm happy too.<br>
There's one more item that the king of Aden has ordered to give young adventurers. A pendant.<br>
As you can guess, pendants also can be enchanted.<br>
And one more thing that you should know. A new special shop has opened in the continent lately. You can buy there amazing items using <font color="LEVEL">L-Coins</font>. I hope it's useful information.
