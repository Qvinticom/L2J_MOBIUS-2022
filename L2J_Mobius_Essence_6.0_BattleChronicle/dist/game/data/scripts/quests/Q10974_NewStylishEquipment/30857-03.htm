So, listen carefully.<br>
First I'll tell you about hair accessories.<br>
Hair accessories change your appearance. To enchant a hair accessory you need special enchanting scrolls.<br>
They say, seeing once is better than hearing twice. So I've prepared <font color="LEVEL">Adventurer's Sheep Hat</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Adventurer's Scroll: Enchant Hair Accessory</font> for you. Use them and enchant equipment. It's easy.<br>
Speak to me again when you've finished.<br>
