This year is really stressing for everybody, and I would really like to lighten up the mood somehow.<br>
That is why I've decided to plant beautiful flowers, but unfortunately all my seeds have been lost. Then I've heard about people finding boxes with seeds all over the world! I think those are mine! But how am I going to collect them?<br>
If you find Augustina's Chests while traveling, could you please get the seeds out of them and bring them back to me?<br>
I'll exchange them for useful items, so come back any time.<br>
