The Queen Ant lives in the <font color="LEVEL">Ant Nest</font>. If you want to kill her, you should go there.<br>
However, the Ant Nest is a very dangerous place. If I send there everybody, many will die in vain. So only those who meet certain requirements can go.<br>
First of all, you have to be <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 65 or higher</font> to go to the Ant Nest. Secondly, you must find yourself a <font color="LEVEL">command channel</font> with <font color="LEVEL">50-200 members</font>.<br>
If you manage to defeat the Queen Ant, you will be rewarded.<br>
