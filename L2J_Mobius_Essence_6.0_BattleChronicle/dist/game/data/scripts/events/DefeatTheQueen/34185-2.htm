So, the Queen Ant is dead, Perfect!<br>
I must say I've never doubted your capability to deal with troubles, because at the very moment I saw you and your friends I understood that all of you were very experienced warriors.<br>
Our order has prepared a special buff for those who have defeated the Queen Ant. I hope you like the gift.<br>
Also I can teleport you anywhere, just say a word!<br>
