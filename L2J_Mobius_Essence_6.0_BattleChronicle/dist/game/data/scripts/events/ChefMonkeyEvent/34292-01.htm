<html><body>Event Manager Chef Monkey:<br>
One morning, I opened my eyes and found myself a genius chef! I am Chef Monkey.<br>
I have come to the Aden Continent to bring happiness to all through my food! Even the monsters have eaten my food! They drop bananas when they die!<br>
The fish love the bait I make! They can't get enough! You can use my super bait to catch a special Tuna fish!<br>
Oh, that will be a great fishing! Especially if you have a delicious Banana Cocktail with you. Alleviate your tiredness with fishing!<br>
