Look at you, you beam with joy! Did something good happen? Or just going to happen? If it's already happened we have to drink to that. And if it's not, you've come to the right place. I'm going to sell some goods at lower prices.<br>
So if you need something it's the high time for good shopping! When you have everything you need, happiness is coming up. There's no 'tomorrow' for a poor adventurer but only 'today'.<br>
