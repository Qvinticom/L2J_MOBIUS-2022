<html><body>Trader Rolento:<br>
I am Rolento of the Iron Scale Guild! I was sent here to open the store. This place is between Giran and Gludin, it is perfect for trade. Of course there was a good fight inside the guild for this place, but I was chosen to take it after all! So... What can I help you with?<br>
