Of course, in order to create a dualsword weapon you need to have something to work with, a pair of swords.<br>
In addition to that, no Artisan would work for free.They need to make their living after all.... Running the forge isn't cheap either...<br>
Hm...There's something else.... You need both swords to be well balanced otherwise you they make a good dualsword weapon. That's why you can only join swords of the same grade.<br>
I can only work with up to C-grade weapons. If you want something better you should go to a bigger city. You should also keep in mind that any weapon modifications will be lost in the fusion.<br>
There's more.... If a weapon has some unique property it won't work. Fusion's impossible. Any questions? Of course, you know everything there is to know.<br>
Well, choose the swords you want to get!<br>
