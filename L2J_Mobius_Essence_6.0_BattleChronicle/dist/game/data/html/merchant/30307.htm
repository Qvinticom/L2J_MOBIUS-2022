Obviously, elves are experts in blacksmithing, althogh they focus on mithril. No doubt it's perfect material... strong, light and good for magic enhancements.<br>
But I look beyond this tradition and research other metals too. I know how to work on adammantite and damascus, also not long ago. I've learned how to work on oriharukon.<br>
