Oh... Welcome! Are you tired? You can rest here. What brought you here? No, don't answer if you don't want to... But as you wish. I know why people come to the Hunters Village! They want to hunt... Am I wrong? Am I?<br>
This village is home for hunters. Don't stay there, come here and look at the goods. Maybe you thought I'm the one who is doing all day nothing but talking and talking without stopping?<br>
