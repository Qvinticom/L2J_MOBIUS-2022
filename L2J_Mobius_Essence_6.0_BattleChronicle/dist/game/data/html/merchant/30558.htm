On to immortal glory of the flame flower! I'm greeting you, flame brother!<br>
How can I help you? Please, look at my equipment and you will see that only goods of the highest quality can be found here. Tell me what do you need? There's nothing I can't find for you! Everybody knows that a good journey requires good preparations. Without them only defeat and shame are awaiting you! Even us, noble orcs, can suffer from small field critters if we aren't prepared for this.<br>
