Who are you? What do you want?<br>
Oh, I think it's too rude... Well, let's try again. So, What brought you here?<br>
Nah, it doesn't matter... I can't break old habits too... Don't get me wrong, I'm not an old crazy man. But actually I don't know myself if I'm crazy or not... Anyway, the goods you see are goods of the finest quality!<br>
