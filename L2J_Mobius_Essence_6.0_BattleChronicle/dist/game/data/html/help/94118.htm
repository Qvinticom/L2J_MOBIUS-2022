<html><body>Pet Guide:<br>
There are 6 animals that can be pets: <font color="LEVEL">Wolf, Buffalo, Tiger, Kookaburra, Dragon and Hawk</font>.<br>
To get a pet you need to <font color="LEVEL">kill Atingo</font> who can be found in the <font color="LEVEL">Plains of the Lizardmen, the Dragon Valley, the 1-5 floors of the Tower of Insolence and the Orc Barracks</font>.<br>
After you kill Atingo, his pet will have no owner. Kill it to receive a <font color="LEVEL">Sealed Necklace</font>.<br>
During battle your summoned <font color="LEVEL">pet</font> will <font color="LEVEL">receive XP points</font> just like you character.<br>
The experience your pet gains is used for <font color="LEVEL">leveling up</font>. After reaching <font color="LEVEL">Lv.40</font> the <font color="LEVEL">1st evolution</font> will become available and after reaching <font color="LEVEL">Lv.76</font> you can initiate the <font color="LEVEL">2nd evolution</font>.<br>
Your pet can't evolve unless you have an <font color="LEVEL">Enhanced</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Regular Pet Training Guide</font>.
