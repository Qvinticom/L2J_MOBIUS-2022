Greeting, I am Alshpes, a moneylender. My Elven brother may criticize me for lending money, but I don't care. They says they're not right? But in times like these, don't they know that one needs money above anything, even if one is an Elf? Don't you think so?<br>
Oh, and by the way, don't think about borrowing money from me. These days, I'm thinking of a <font color="LEVEL">new business</font> so I'm putting a hold on money lending. I should go pursue sales in a Human village or something...<br>
