O' folloower of the Flame!<br>
Be welcome here! I have been dispatched here to the Town of Gludio, but I have not forgotten our pride, our honor, our glody. The same cannot be said of the wertched Turek, Enku, and Vuki tribes. They are foul and deserve to be crused forever! Do not follow their example.... stay true to your heritage!<br>
