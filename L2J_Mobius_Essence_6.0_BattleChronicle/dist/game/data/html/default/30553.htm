I must kill them! I must kill them all! Huge mouth! Gigantic eyes! The rough sound of breathing! I still remember everything.... Right in front of me, it opened its mouth and swallowed my parents and grandma....Finally, it was about to lunge out to eat me! Then a Bounty Hunter appeared all of a sudden and saved my life....<br>
If it wasn't for that stupid Bounty Hunter, I wouldn't have had to live like this.... Everyone was killed! Only I survived! I should have been killed with my parents and grandma.... Do you know how hard it for a woman to live alone? I will kill the wolves! I kill them all!!!! <font color="LEVEL">I will kill the wolves who took my happiness away!!!</font><br>
