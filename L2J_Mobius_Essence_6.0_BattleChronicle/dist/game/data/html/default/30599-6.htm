It is proper and praiseworth to remain on the lookout for new quests. Is not your ultimate purpose to fight for the good of all Elvenkind? I will tell you of all the quests I know of for Mystics of your level. However, there may be others that I have not heard of, therefore speak to the other villages to discover their needs.<br>
I can tell you that there are one-time quests that you may only complete once, but also repetitive quests that may be undertaken several times.<br>
