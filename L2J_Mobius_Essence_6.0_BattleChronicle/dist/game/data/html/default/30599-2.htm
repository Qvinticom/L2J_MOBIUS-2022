First, consider your goal. The Kingdom of Aden is currently in chaos. What better time will there be to restore the Elven people to their ancient greatness?<br>
For now, the most important thing is simply to get experience with your arts is combat. What could be a higher priority in such times as these?<br>
Begin your training by hunting <font color="LEVEL">Red Keltirs </font> or <font color="LEVEL">Wolves</font> near the village. Be cautious, particularly with the Wolves, for they are very savege. When you find an item after slaying a monster, tryto equip it, to see if it's better than what you have now. For the rest, if you have no other use for it, sell it at the stores, so you will have Adena when you need it.<br>
