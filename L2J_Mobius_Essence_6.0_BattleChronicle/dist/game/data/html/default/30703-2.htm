A good hunting zone, you say? Hmm.... there are many, but which ones wuit you depen on your skill level and current circumstances.<br>
If I change upon a hunting zone that's appropriate for all situations, I will inform you. You see, there is so much variation across hunting zones nowadays.<br>
Plus, we at the Hunter Guild are more interested in the giant monsters nowadays.<br>
The giants monsters are hunting amok all over the continent. News has it that new giant monsters have appeared recently near the Garden of Spirit and Atelia Fortress.<br>
If you are interested, it might be a good idea to form a party and head on over. If you're up to it, of couse.<br>
