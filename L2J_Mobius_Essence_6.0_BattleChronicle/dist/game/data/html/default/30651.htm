Maphr, the goddess of anbundance and prosperity?! Foolish castle, they don't know anything! Just look at the silly Dwarves in this town. Theye are mentally unbalanced, always dashing here and there to collect some more money. They are simply ridiculous! Miserable creatures who would even rip out their goodess' heart if it were worth money! And they don't hesitate to unearth things that should not be part of this world!<br>
Maphr is indeed the goddess of anbundance and prosperity, but that also means that she is responsible for all poverty and downfalls! Whay can't you see this simple fact! They have already experienced bankruptcy once before.... Tsk tsk...<br>
