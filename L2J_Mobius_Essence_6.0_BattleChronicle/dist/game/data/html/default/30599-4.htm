Try hunting <font color="LEVEL">Red Keltirs </font> or <font color="LEVEL">Wolves</font> near the village. Your spells are your most powerful attacks, so look for monsters you can defeat with a singel spell until you reach at least level 3.<br>
At level 6 or above, go southeast and challenge <font color="LEVEL">Kaboo Orcs.</font> An important rule of thumb at these levels is to <font color="LEVEL">hunt the strongest monster you can defeat with two Wind Strikes.</font> And never forget that Orcs are dangerous, because if one is in danger, others will often come to join the fight.<br>
