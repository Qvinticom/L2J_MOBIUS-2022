My family ran a vineyard in Gludio for generations. But two years ago, during the war with Gracia, it was all burned down by the plundering convict troops. My brother and cousins who tried to save the farm all died terrible deaths.<br>
Ahh, it is a painful past that i do not want to recall.<br1>
Please ask no more.<br>
