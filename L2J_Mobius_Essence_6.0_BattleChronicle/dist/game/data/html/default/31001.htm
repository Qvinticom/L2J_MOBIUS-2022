I will tell you a story, one of ancient immorality. Long ago, in place far away, there once lived a beautiful princess, with auburn hair, amerald eyes and golden, rich skin. Her beauty renowned throughout the lands, and this young princess was spoken about so much that her mother, the Queen, grew jealous and insecure, eventually twisting her mind into such knots that she plotted to have her own daughter killed. The King discovered her evil plot, and when he tried to stop his wife she became so enraged she sent a killer for the King instead.<br>
After the assassin's blade had done its work, the country fell into a state of anarchy and civil war, while the bond between mother and daughter fell from love to sadness, and then sadness to hatred. Then... then.... Oh my, then what? I do believe I've forgotten my own story! Good lord!<br>
