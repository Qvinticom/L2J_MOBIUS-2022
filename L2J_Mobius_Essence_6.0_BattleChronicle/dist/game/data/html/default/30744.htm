<html><body>Guild Member Grey:<br>
You should not think of the Hunters Guild as a group whose members chase after rabbits and deer. We hunt the most precious of treasures, destroying evildoers and exploring ruins. We specialize in searching, tracking and hunting, and never fail to archieve our goals. We also have an awesome fighting ability.<br>
Ah, but first I should introduce myself. I am Hunters Guild member Grey.<br>
Colin and I were sent to the Town of Aden to carry out the missions of the Hunter Guild. If you want to buy a Hunter Guild Request, just tell me.<br>
