<html><body>Prefect Reva:<br>
I was send to Aden, the capital of the Human 'kingdom', to make known the will of Pa'agrio! Our Elders have sensed the approach of an endless winter that will cover all the races of this land with ice and cold. Only through our combined strength, and with the blessing of Pa'agri, can we defeat the forces of darkness! When that day comes, we Orcs will be at forefront of battle, and we will make the rivers overflow with the cold blood of our enemies!<br1>
