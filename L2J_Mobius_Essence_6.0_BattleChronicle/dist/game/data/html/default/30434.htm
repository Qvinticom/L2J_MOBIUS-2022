Hmm? How strange it is for someone to speak to me.<br1>
Arent' you afraid of me? Everyone avoids me,<br1>
whispering that I am a leper or a pagan. They are a foolish race that is afraid or jealous if something is slightly different from themselves....<br>
Well .....! It is rather better for me. It is comforable not having people bother you.<br>
