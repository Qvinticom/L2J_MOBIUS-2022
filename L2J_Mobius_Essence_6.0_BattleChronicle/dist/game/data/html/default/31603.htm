Welcome, kiddo.!<br>
Haha, has my calling you kiddo; annoyed you? Well, I've lived for hundreds of years, so everyone is a kid to me!<br>
Still, now that I think of it, you kiddos nowadays have a lot of fight in you. A good example would be Arcturus, the new Hunter Guild President.<br>
I was originally thinking of leaving the Hunter Guild, but I have decided to stay a while longer to partake in the dreams of Arcturus.<br>
Arcturus say that he will be issuing requests to those who fight against the giant monsters. Tell me if you're interested.<br>
