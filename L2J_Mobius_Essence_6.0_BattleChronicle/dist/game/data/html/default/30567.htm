Tejakar Pa'agrio! Praise the name of the Flame! This Immortal Plateau has been our sacred ground from ancient times, but while I, Tantus, was living among the humans of the <font color="LEVEL">Kingdom of Elmore,</font> foreign invaders and Orc traitors brought disgrace to this land!<br>
Now I am back, and I will not forgive those who disgraced our sacred place!<br>
