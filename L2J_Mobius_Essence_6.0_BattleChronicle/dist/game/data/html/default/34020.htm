<html><body>Agent of Devil's Isle Nikia:<br>
Hello! This is Devil's Isle. It's almost safe here, at the entrance to this huge maze-like island. And rumors have it that deep intothe island hordes of bloodthirsty monsters patiently wait for fresh adventures!<br>
I haven't ventured that far myself, though... So I can't confirm or deny those rumors! Don't even bother asking me about all of that. Simply don't know what is really going on there.<br>
