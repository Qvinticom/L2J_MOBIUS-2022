<html><body>Captain Mouen:<br>
Welcome to Oren, young traveler! My name is Mouen. I serve my Master and keep order in Oren.<br>
Oren demands more serious safety measures, because it is situated near Elmore, the enemy of Aden. There measures may cause some inconvenience, but we hope for understanding.<br>
These places are close to the northern border and many local people have a lot in common with the people of Elmore in their habits and way of living. Woodmen do not really care about being so close to the border. There are very few of us who have any relatives or friends in Elmore, ha-ha!<br>
This big tower on the northern hill is Oren Caslte. Every time I look at the castle, I pray that our people live in piece and the people of Elmore realise how strong this fortification is.<br>
