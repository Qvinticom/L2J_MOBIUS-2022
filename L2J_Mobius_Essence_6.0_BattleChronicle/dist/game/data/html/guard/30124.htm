Lately I've been scouting in the <font color="FFFF00">Death Pass</font>. There I've seen flying Harpies and Medusas. Awful creatures! Don't be deceived by their beautiful appearance! Noo mere mortal could escape their claws. Now I'm facing even worse monsters. I think I can mage them, but what about poor locals...?<br>
