<html><body>Guard Lucas:<br>
Welcome! I'm glad to see you here in Dion. My name is Lucas, I'm responsible for the safety here. Is this your first time in Dion? I don't know why you've come to our lands, but I want to say, that it is a peaceful and calm place. Please don't cause any problems while you are here in the village.<br>
But as soon as you leave the village, you will face many dangers. It is better to be not alone out there.<br>
