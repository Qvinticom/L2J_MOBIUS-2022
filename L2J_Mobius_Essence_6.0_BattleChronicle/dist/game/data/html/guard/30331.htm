Our captain is a tidy person. He says that if you stand guard the lord's castle you have to look shipshape. But I think the lord has no time to examine clothing of a random guardsman...<br>
Are you agree? Why scolding for clothing? Abilities and skills, they are important, not appearance... But people are always like that, even looking for an apron they are trying to find a good-looking one.<br>
