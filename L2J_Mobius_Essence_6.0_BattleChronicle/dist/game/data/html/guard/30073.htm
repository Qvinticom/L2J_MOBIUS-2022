Hello! Hey, traveler! Have you come here to see the giant shell of <font color="LEVEL">Cruma</font> with your own eyes? If so, then I would recommend you you to turn back. Many who wanted to find the shell of Cruma never came back. It is situated somewhere in the <font color="LEVEL">Marshlands</font>, it is very dangerous out there because of all the monsters. Even we don't dare to go there.<br>
