Do you go to Giran? Then follow this road without any detour. If you leave the path, you can encounter <font color="LEVEL">Gracian Survivors</font>, and that means trouble for sure. Those are ruthless villains... Take my advice, visit the temple before you go and pray Einhasad to protect you from those thugs.<br>
