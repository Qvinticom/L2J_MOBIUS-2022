<html><body>Sentry Kayleen:<br>
Greetings. Have you seen many places? My wish is to adventure in the wide, outside world someday. When I give up my job as sentry, I am thinking of traveling to Elmore. If you go there, there is the village of <font color="LEVEL">Pavel</font> built by Dark Elves.<br>
Maybe it's just because of the oppreessive atmosphere that hangs around the <font color="LEVEL">School of Dark Arts,</font> but sometimes my wish seems a very remote possibility.<br>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 1">"Tell me about Pavel."</Button>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 2">"The School of Dark Arts?"</Button>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_TerritoryStatus">"Can you tell me about the local lord and tax rate?".</Button>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="QUEST" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Quest">Quest</Button>
