May the Song of the west wind bring you rest in the night. I am Sentry Altima. I admit that I have a soft nature. I applied to become a Sentry to change my cowardly character. Now, as you can see, I have been born as a strong Sentry.<br>
If you follow this path that I guard, you can go out towards the <font color="LEVEL">Dark Forest.</font><br>
