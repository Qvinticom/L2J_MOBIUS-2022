I only know what I've heard. Abnormal weather has been a problem recently, and the harbors in the northen part of Kingdom of Elmore are frozen. This could be the beginning of the everlasting winter, a prophecy handed down among Orcs from ancient times. When the everlasting winter comes, all land will be frozen, and all races will be wiped out. Then, Lord Pa'agrio will come down and save the world, it is said.<br>
