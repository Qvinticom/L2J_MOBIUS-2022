(This note lists tool crafting Ingredients that Uska needs.)<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Bear's Shin Bone</font><br>
These bones are very strong and smooth, pleasnat to touch.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Sharp Spider Leg</font><br>
The tip of this Spider Leg is so sharp that it can easily drill not only bone, but stone as well. It would be a perfect tool if only it didn't go blunt so fast.<br>
Work tools are used a lot and wear out fast. Tha's why we need so much materials. Well, good luck.
