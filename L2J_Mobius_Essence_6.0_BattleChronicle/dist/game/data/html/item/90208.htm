<html><body>Lector's Notes:<br>
Everyone knows that Web of giant spiders is sturdier than steel. And Web of <font color="LEVEL">Giant, Giant Blade and Fang Spiders</font> who inhabit the Talking Island, is famous for its softness and shine that makes is a common material for adorning armor. Unfortunately, it's hard to color. The only way is to add <font color="LEVEL">Essence of Water</font> to the paint, and that Essence is procured by slaying Undines. But if drops of regular water get mixed in with <font color="LEVEL">Essence of Water</font>, then, despite the name, <font color="LEVEL">Essence of Water</font> will lose its magical abilities. That's why it needs to be stored in a dry place. In short, keep it safe.<br>
