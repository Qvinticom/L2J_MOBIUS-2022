(List of Materials required for making a Necklace and Red Gem Necklace that were stolen by Imps.)<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Red Gem</font><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Sumari</font> sent me this gem to put into Necklace. It's harder than a diamond and glows red from inside. Every jeweler dreams of cutting such a gem. But <font color="LEVEL">Kasha Imps</font> stole it! If <font color="LEVEL">Sumari</font> find out, he will be furious. Please, get it back quickly! Kill <font color="LEVEL">Kasha Imps</font> to find it.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Hard Lens</font><br>
You can make white powder from dried lens of Evil Eye Seers. A stone polished with this powder becomes very smooth. Imps turned over and apilled the whole jar of this powder, and I need it for my work. Bring me some lens of <font color="LEVEL">Evil Eye Seers</font>.
