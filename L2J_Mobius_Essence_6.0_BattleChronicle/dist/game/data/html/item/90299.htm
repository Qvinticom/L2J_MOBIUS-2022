<html><body>Maintenance Request:<br>
(This looks like an answer for Priest Gerald's request to repair a broken statue.)<br>
We have made an estimate for your request. Restoration of the statue at the cost of 2500 Adena does not seem possible.<br>
This work will cost you at least 200,000 Adena. See below of the detailed estimation.<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Hunter Tarantula's Venom</font>: 5000 Adena for a piece. 20 pcs. needed.<br>
Necessary for gluing the broken pieces. If you want to use quality material for Marphr's statue, then you need to pay at least 5000 Adena for a piece.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Plunder Taratula's Kidney Stone</font>: 10,000 Adena for a piece. 10 pcs. needed.<br>
You do not have to pick the most expensive stones. But if you do not want spots to appear on the statue, then expect one piece to cost 10,000 Adena. The damage is to big. At least 10 stones are needed to get rid of it.<br><br>
Sum-total: 200,000 Adena<br>
And this is just the cost of materials. If you add the fee for the work itself, then it will be from 250,000 to 300,000 Adena in total.<br>
