Payne sent this note to Vollodos when ordering the Shiels from him. It includes his comments for the order.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Order Deatails</font>.<br>
Order for making and sale of the Shield of Silence.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">1. Stone Giant Guardian's Core</font>.<br>
Please base the Shield on Stone Giant Guardian's Core and reinforce it with brass from the sides.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">2. Crystalline Beast's Shinedust</font>.<br>
Not as good at dispelling magic as we thought. My advice is to use a thicker layer of it for better protection.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">3. Giant Spider Skin Fragment</font><br>
Patterns in the form of knots are popular in Giran Castle nowadays. You can glue together parts of the Shield and interlay them with leather straps braided into knots.
