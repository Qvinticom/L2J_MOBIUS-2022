Resemble dogs, hunt in packs. Wolf pelts can be used to make great bags, shoes and leather armor.<br><br>

Tribes of these savages live separately from all others. Orcs aren't fond of strangers. They've been attacking the residents of the Talking Island more and more lately.<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">3. Werewolf</font>.<br>
A Monster with a wolf head but human body. Their intellect is on par with Humans. But they are not fit well for human live because of their bloodthirsty nature. werewolves should be kept clear of, especially on a full moon.<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">4. Orc Warrior</font>.<br>
More skilled at material arts than other Orcs. No battle scouting expedition or a fight goes without them.
