Collect Tails to mark Monsters that need to be hunted. You need to procure at least 1000 of Ashen Wolf Tails. Each participant has to bring at least 10 of them.<br><br>

Goblins somehow found out about the location of the hunt and came running from all over the region. Take their poisonous darts from them, or they are going to spoil our hunt.<br><br>
