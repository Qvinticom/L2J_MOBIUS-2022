Do you want to add special properties to your weapon? Good! Though what are you worried about? Oh, your weapon is enchanted, right? Don't fret about it! Your weapon's enchant value will not be affected.<br>
I'm talking about <font color="LEVEL">Soul Crystals</font> now. Our blacksmiths can insert one in your weapon if it has a slot for it.<br>
Just choose a crystal you want to insert and a weapon for it, that's all.<br>
By the way, if you have many unnecessary Soul Crystals, give them to me, and I'll exchange them for other ones. Though, of course, I can't say that you'll get in return.<br>
But why not try your luck? Our life is a gamble, after all.<br>
