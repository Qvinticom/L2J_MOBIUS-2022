Of course, in order to create a dual swords you need to have something to work with, a pair of swords.<br>
Also take into consideration that no artisan will work for free. They need to make their living after all...<br1>
Running the forge isn't cheap either...<br>
There's something else... You need both swords to be well balanced, otherwise they won't make a good weapon. That's why you can only combine swords of the same grade.<br>
I work only with weapon of grades D and C. If you want something better, you should go to someplace bigger.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Please, keep in mind that any weapon modifications will be lost in the fusion procress.</font><br>
Are you event listening to me? Of course not, you know everything  there is to know.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Also I can't combine swords that are imbued with Soul Crystals, so please remove them beforehand.</font><br>
Well, choose the swords you want to get!<br>
