This is the Forge of the Gods. Remember that it is very dangerous here. Monsters can surround you at any time.<br>
I will tell you that I managed to find out about this place. At the lower level there are more dangerous monsters than at the top. Therefore, I advise you to go there with colleagues. Alone you can go to the top level. But the road there is dangerous and difficult. Therefore, I will teleport you.<br>
By the way, there is one place that I discovered quite recently. It seems to me that lives there <font color="LEVEL">King of the Spirits of Fire</font>. I can tell you more, if you're interested..<br>
