My name is Deton. I'm a travelling archaeologist. I'm always glad to give a helping hand to other travelers.<br>
Archaeologist allows us to uncover the secret knowledge of ancient times. My research has enable me to learn the art of teleportation. With this incredible ability I can teleport you for free wherever you want to.<br>
If you want, you can travel to the Alligator Island. But be careful, there are many dangerous monsters in the Swampland.<br>
