Have you ever heard of this place? Until recently, I personally did not know anything about him. But after arriving here and doing some research, much became clear. Now I will tell you about what I managed to find out. There are always strong winds blowing. They not only sweep away everything in their path, but also bring with them strange creatures. Especially dangerous in the eastern part of these lands.<br>
I do not advise to go there alone. But the harbor is the only safe place. If you want, I can send you there.<br>
This place has recently been discovered, but rumors are already circulating here <font color="LEVEL">incredibly strong influence of wind energy</font>. Most likely, this is due to the King of the Spirits of the Wind.<br><br>
