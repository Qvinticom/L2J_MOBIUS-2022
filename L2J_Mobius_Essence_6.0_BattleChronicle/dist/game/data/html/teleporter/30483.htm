<html><body>Ivory Tower Wizard Carsus:<br>
My name is Carsus, I'm from the Investigator Guild. I've been sent here recently from the Ivory Tower. The Investigators have come here to study the lower levels of the tower, since the upper half has already been explored.<br>
We've set up an <font color="LEVEL">elevator</font> to begin our research with the <font color="LEVEL">3rd floor of the dungeon</font> which is considered to be the last dangerous. If you need any help moving around, I will gladly help you. All you need to do is tell me which floor you would like to go to.<br>
But keep in mind that the 1st floor is the home of a Raid Boss that controls all the creatures in the Cruma Tower. I can't help you get there. If you want to go to the 1st floor, you need to talk to <font color="LEVEL">Ivory Tower Wizard Ian</font>. He can be found on the <font color="LEVEL">2nd floor</font>.<br>
