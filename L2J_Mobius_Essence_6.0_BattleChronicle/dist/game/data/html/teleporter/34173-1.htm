<html><body>Undercover Agent Khamin:<br>
Our scouts have brought information that Jisra can be seen only short periods of time. In 30 minutes before every even hour a secret pathway is opened, it won't be closed for 30 minutes. If you follow the way and kill Escorts, Escort Captain Cooca will come to find out what's going on.<br>
Keep in mind you have to kill Cooca first. If you can defeat him, you can defeat Jisra.<br>
Cooca has cast a powerful protection spell on Jisra, so without killing Cooca you most likely fail to deal with Jisra.<br>
Our mages say that after Cooca's death his spell will be unleashed and sweep away from the camp everybody who wasn't in the combat. So good luck.<br>
