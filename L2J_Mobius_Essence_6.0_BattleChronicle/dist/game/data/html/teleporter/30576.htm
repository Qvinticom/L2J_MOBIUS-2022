Have you heard about the Ivory Tower? The place where Gatekeeper are studying? You must know the place! Every self-respecting magic user have to go there and see that amazing construction!<br>
I see curiosity in your eyes. Good! Are you ready to witness a true miracle?<br>
(You can teleport to Gludin, if you have a Gatekeeper Charm.)<br>
