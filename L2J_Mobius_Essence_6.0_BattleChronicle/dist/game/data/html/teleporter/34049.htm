<html><body>Tritan:<br>
This is the Wall of Argos. Do you know what happened here? After the spirits came here, the place changed beyond recognition. Southeast of the entrance is very dangerous, so exploring these places is better not alone, but in a place with colleagues.<br>
Have you ever heard of a creature called The Stone Giant? Well, that's what travelers called him. This is actually <font color="LEVEL">King of the Earth Spirits</font>. And he is very strong. Want to know more about him? I am happy to tell you.<br>
