<html><body>Tritan:<br>
Oh, I got you interested, right? As a child I read an old book about the King of Spirits <font color="LEVEL">Petrama</font>. True, I always thought of Petram as a mere fiction. And then the ships invaded the spirits, and I had to do research to find out the reason. Imagine my surprise when I realized that Peter really exists!<br>
He's just huge! His body is like a rock, and his fists are like huge boulders. What else to tell? Hmm ..... Oh, yes! In that old book it was written that <font color="LEVEL">the stones covering the body of the King of the Earth Spirits make it virtually invulnerable</font>.<br>
He is really incredibly strong and dangerous. Therefore, to meet with Peter must be prepared. You have to develop <font color="LEVEL">a force that will help resist earth energy</font>. When you are ready, come along with colleagues, and I will tell you where to find this giant.<br>
