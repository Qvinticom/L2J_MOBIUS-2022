<html><body>Tara:<br>
I went to study one place where the energy of the fire was very strong. At that moment, when the radiation became incredibly powerful, I saw a beautiful maiden, over whose head I took off a huge silhouette woven from a burning flame. It was the King of Spirits <font color="LEVEL">Fire Ignis</font>. Somehow he managed to divide himself and gain two bodies.<br>
And you know, it's very strange, but in the same place I saw <font color="LEVEL">Ice Queen Freya</font>. What could Freya do where the energy of fire pulsates? King Ignis has not yet declared himself openly, but is hiding and accumulating strength. Perhaps, when he leaves the shelter, Aden will plunge into chaos. Therefore, it is necessary in whatever would prevent Ignis.<br>
But first you need to get <font color="LEVEL">a force that will help withstand the energy of fire</font>. Collect loyal supporters and come back !!! Alone you can not cope.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">(You need a command channel of 18 or more characters.)</font>.<br1>
