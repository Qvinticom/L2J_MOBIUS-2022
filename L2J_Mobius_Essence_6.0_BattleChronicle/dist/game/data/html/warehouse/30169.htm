<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Marty:<br>
If you have an item that's too heavy to carry around, but to valuable to leave just anywhere, consider using our warehouse! Our dwarven businessmen own just about all the warehouse and banking business in the entire continent. Aside from that, when you store your item with us, you can retrieve it anywhere!<br>
What do you think? We even have a branch inside the Ivory Tower that the royal family cannot touch!<br1>
True story!<br>
