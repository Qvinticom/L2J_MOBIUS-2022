<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Radic:<br>
Greetings, adventurer. Welcome to the Ivory Tower. Why don't you deposit your property and have a tour of the tower? This is the basement floor, on the upper floors there are several guilds for Mystics and Magi. This tower is an important place for Mystics, as is the town.<br>
It was a powerful place during the Elmoreden empire...<br>
