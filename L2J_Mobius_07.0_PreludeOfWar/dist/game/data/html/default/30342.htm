Have you ever looked closely at a dead man's face? The face of a living person constantly changes from one emotion to another. But it's different with dead people. Their face freezes at the moment of death. Some corpses look scared, some look amazed, but there are people who meet death calmly... It seems that you find this topic unpleasant. We will all die some day, so why avoid talking about death?<br>
I've been around dead people since I was a child, so death doesn't faze me anymore. I come from a long line of <font color="LEVEL">undertakers</font>. But we haven't had a lot of business since the priests of Einhasad have started burning corpses. Nobody want to bury their dead anymore. It's viewed as an archaic custom, so very few people actually want to do that.<br>
