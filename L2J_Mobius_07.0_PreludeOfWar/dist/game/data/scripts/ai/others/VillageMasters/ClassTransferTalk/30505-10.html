To become an Orc Raider, the appropriate level and token are required. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify for a class transfer. You also need a token, to prove you have passed the Test of the Orc Raider.<br>
However, it seems that your level is not high enough, and you have not yet passed the Test of the Orc Raider. First, work to raise your level to 20 or higher. To take the Test of the Orc Raider, go to <font color="LEVEL">Prefect Karukia of the Orc Village</font>. She will tell you everything you need to know. If you pass the test and come back, I will change your class. To get to the Orc Village, first go to Gludio, then use a Gatekeeper to go to the Orc Village.<br>
